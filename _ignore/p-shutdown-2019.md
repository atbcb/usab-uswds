-   Federal officers may incur obligations as necessary for orderly termination of an agency's functions, but funds may not be disbursed.

**2. SCOPE:**  This plan applies to all agency personnel, including presidentially-appointed private citizens on the Access Board who serve as Special Government Employees (SGEs).

-   Director of Administration will notify all agency personnel of shutdown status and will initiate action to issue furlough notices and other instructions as appropriate.
-   Director of Administration will direct Contracting Officer's Representatives to notify agency contractors of shutdown status and other instructions as appropriate.
