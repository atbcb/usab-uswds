<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V703.3 Braille.</strong>&nbsp; Contracted (Grade 2) braille is an abbreviated method of displaying words in braille.&nbsp; For example, the word “men” is displayed using the braille symbols for “m” and “en”.&nbsp; The word “women” would use the braille symbols for “w”, “o”, “m”, and “en”.&nbsp; Some grouping of letters have no contracted form, such as exit which would appear as “e”, “x”, “i”, and “t”.&nbsp; Also, numbers have no contracted form.&nbsp; Numbers in braille are created by using “a” to “j” for 1 to 0.&nbsp; By putting a “#” sign in front of the letter or letters the reader is told these are numbers not letters.&nbsp; Therefore, #abc means 123 and #aj means 10.</p>

<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V704.3 Volume Control Telephones.</strong>&nbsp; Amplifiers on pay phones are located in the base or the handset or are built into the telephone.&nbsp; Most are operated by pressing a button or key.&nbsp; If the microphone in the handset is not being used, a mute button that temporarily turns off the microphone can also reduce the amount of background noise which the person hears in the earpiece.&nbsp; If a volume adjustment is provided that allows the user to set the level anywhere from the base volume to the upper requirement of 20 dB, there is no need to specify a lower limit.&nbsp; If a stepped volume control is provided, one of the intermediate levels must provide 12 dB of gain.&nbsp; Consider compatibility issues when matching an amplified handset with a phone or phone system.&nbsp; Amplified handsets that can be switched with pay telephone handsets are available.&nbsp; Portable and inline amplifiers can be used with some phones but are not practical at most public phones covered by these requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Advisory V706.1 General.</strong>&nbsp; Assistive listening systems are generally categorized by their mode of transmission.&nbsp; There are hard-wired systems and three types of wireless systems: induction loop, infrared, and FM radio transmission.&nbsp; Each has different advantages and disadvantages that can help determine which system is best for a given application.&nbsp; For example, an FM system may be better than an infrared system in some open-air assemblies since infrared signals are less effective in sunlight.&nbsp; On the other hand, an infrared system is typically a better choice than an FM system where confidential transmission is important because it will be contained within a given space.&nbsp; Induction loop systems, however, enable persons who use hearing aids (or cochlear implants) equipped with telecoils to use the system without needing a separate receiver and headset</p>
<p>The technical standards for assistive listening systems describe minimum performance levels for volume, interference, and distortion.&nbsp; Sound pressure levels (SPL), expressed in decibels, measure output sound volume.&nbsp; Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR or S/N), also expressed in decibels, represents the relationship between the loudness of a desired sound (the signal) and the background noise in a space or piece of equipment.&nbsp; The higher the SNR, the more intelligible the signal.&nbsp; The peak clipping level limits the distortion in signal output produced when high-volume sound waves are manipulated to serve assistive listening devices.</p>
<p>Selecting or specifying an effective assistive listening system for a large or complex venue requires assistance from a professional sound engineer who is knowledgeable about assistive technology and the communication needs of people with hearing loss.&nbsp; The Access Board has published technical assistance on assistive listening devices and systems (see www.access-board.gov).</p>
</div>
<p><strong>V706.2 Receiver Jacks.</strong>&nbsp; Receivers required for use with an assistive listening system shall include a 1/8 inch (3.2 mm) standard mono jack.</p>
<p><strong>V706.3 Receiver Hearing-Aid Compatibility.</strong>&nbsp; Receivers required to be hearing-aid compatible shall interface with telecoils in hearing aids through the provision of neck loops.</p>
<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V706.3 Receiver Hearing-Aid Compatibility.</strong>&nbsp; The telecoil is a circuit installed inside many hearing aids (and cochlear implants).&nbsp; When the hearing aid is set to the telecoil mode, the hearing aid can pick up the electromagnetic energy emitted from the neck loop which is connected to an infrared or FM receiver.&nbsp; Receivers that are not compatible with hearing aids include those connected to ear buds (which may require removal of hearing aids), and earphones and headsets that must be worn over the ear which can create disruptive interference in the transmission and can be uncomfortable for people wearing hearing aids.&nbsp; Some headsets can function as neck loops.&nbsp; An exception is provided in V219.3 regarding the requirement of V706.3 where induction loop systems are installed because a telecoil-equipped hearing aid or cochlear implant serves as a receiver.&nbsp; Where inductive loops are provided, inductive loop receivers should be available to ensure access to people with hearing loss who do not use hearing aids or cochlear implants.</p>
<p><strong>V706.4 Sound Pressure Level.</strong>&nbsp; Assistive listening systems shall be capable of providing a sound pressure level of 110 dB minimum and 118 dB maximum with a dynamic range on the volume control of 50 dB.</p>
<p><strong>V706.5 Signal-to-Noise Ratio.</strong>&nbsp; The signal-to-noise ratio for internally generated noise in assistive listening systems shall be 18 dB minimum.</p>
<p><strong>V706.6 Peak Clipping Level.</strong>&nbsp; Peak clipping shall not exceed 18 dB of clipping relative to the peaks of speech.</p>
<h3 id="v707">V707 Automatic Teller Machines and Fare Machines</h3>
<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V707 Automatic Teller Machines and Fare Machines.</strong>&nbsp; Interactive transaction machines (ITMs), other than ATMs, are not covered by Section V707.&nbsp; However, for entities covered by the ADA, the U.S. Department of Justice regulations that implement the ADA provide additional guidance regarding the relationship between these requirements and elements that are not directly addressed by these requirements.&nbsp; Federal procurement law requires that ITMs purchased by the Federal government comply with standards issued by the Access Board under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.&nbsp; This law covers a variety of products, including computer hardware and software, websites, phone systems, fax machines, copiers, and similar technologies.&nbsp; For more information on Section 508 consult the Access Board’s website at www.access-board.gov.</p>
<p><strong>V707.1 General.</strong>&nbsp; Automatic teller machines and fare machines shall comply with V707.</p>
<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V707.1 General.</strong>&nbsp; If fare cards have one tactually distinctive corner they can be inserted with greater accuracy.&nbsp; Token collection devices that are designed to accommodate tokens which are perforated can allow a person to distinguish more readily between tokens and common coins.&nbsp; Place accessible gates and fare vending machines in close proximity to other accessible elements when feasible so the facility is easier to use.</p>
<p><strong>V707.2 Clear Deck Space.</strong>&nbsp; A clear deck space complying with V305 shall be provided.</p>
<p><strong>V707.3 Operable Parts.</strong>&nbsp; Operable parts shall comply with V309.&nbsp; Unless a clear or correct key is provided, each operable part shall be able to be differentiated by sound or touch, without activation.</p>
<p><strong>V707.4 Privacy.</strong>&nbsp; Automatic teller machines shall provide the opportunity for the same degree of privacy of input and output available to all individuals.</p>
<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V707.4 Privacy.</strong>&nbsp; In addition to people who are blind or visually impaired, people with limited reach who use wheelchairs or have short stature, who cannot effectively block the ATM screen with their bodies, may prefer to use speech output.&nbsp; Speech output users can benefit from an option to render the visible screen blank, thereby affording them greater personal security and privacy.</p>
<p><strong>V707.5 Speech Output.</strong>&nbsp; Machines shall be speech enabled.&nbsp; Operating instructions and orientation, visible transaction prompts, user input verification, error messages, and all displayed information for full use shall be accessible to and independently usable by individuals with vision impairments.&nbsp; Speech shall be delivered through a mechanism that is readily available to all users, including but not limited to, an industry standard connector or a telephone handset.&nbsp; Speech shall be recorded or digitized human, or synthesized.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>EXCEPTIONS.&nbsp; 1.</strong>&nbsp; Audible tones shall be permitted instead of speech for visible output that is not displayed for security purposes, including but not limited to, asterisks representing personal identification numbers.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp; Advertisements and other similar information shall not be required to be audible unless they convey information that can be used in the transaction being conducted.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp; Where speech synthesis cannot be supported, dynamic alphabetic output shall not be required to be audible.</p>
<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V707.5 Speech Output.</strong>&nbsp; If an ATM provides additional functions such as dispensing coupons, selling theater tickets, or providing copies of monthly statements, all such functions must be available to customers using speech output.&nbsp; To avoid confusion at the ATM, the method of initiating the speech mode should be easily discoverable and should not require specialized training.&nbsp; For example, if a telephone handset is provided, lifting the handset can initiate the speech mode.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>V707.5.1 User Control.</strong>&nbsp; Speech shall be capable of being repeated or interrupted.&nbsp; Volume control shall be provided for the speech function.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4em;"><strong>EXCEPTION.</strong>&nbsp; Speech output for any single function shall be permitted to be automatically interrupted when a transaction is selected.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>V707.5.2 Receipts.</strong>&nbsp; Where receipts are provided, speech output devices shall provide audible balance inquiry information, error messages, and all other information on the printed receipt necessary to complete or verify the transaction.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4em;"><strong>EXCEPTIONS.&nbsp; 1.</strong>&nbsp;Machine location, date and time of transaction, customer account number, and the machine identifier shall not be required to be audible.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4em;"><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp; Information on printed receipts that duplicates information available on-screen shall not be required to be presented in the form of an audible receipt.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 4em;"><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp; Printed copies of bank statements and checks shall not be required to be audible.</p>
