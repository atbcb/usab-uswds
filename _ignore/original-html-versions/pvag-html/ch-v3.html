<p><strong>V301.1 Scope.</strong>&nbsp; The provisions of Chapter 3 shall apply where required by Chapter 2 or where referenced by a requirement in this document.</p>
<h3 id="v302">V302 Deck Surfaces</h3>
<p><strong>V302.1 General.</strong>&nbsp; Deck surfaces shall be stable, firm, and slip resistant and shall comply with V302.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>EXCEPTIONS.</strong>&nbsp; Areas of sport activity shall not be required to comply with V302.</p>
<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V302.1 General.</strong>&nbsp; A stable surface is one that remains unchanged by contaminants or applied force, so that when the contaminant or force is removed, the surface returns to its original condition.&nbsp; A firm surface resists deformation by either indentations or particles moving on its surface.&nbsp; A slip-resistant surface provides sufficient frictional counterforce to the forces exerted in walking to permit safe ambulation.</p>
<p><strong>V302.2 Carpet.</strong>&nbsp; Carpet or carpet tile shall be securely attached and shall have a firm cushion, or backing or no cushion.&nbsp; Carpet or carpet tile shall have a level loop, textured loop, level cut pile, or level cut/uncut pile texture.&nbsp; Pile height shall be ½ inch (13 mm) maximum.&nbsp; Exposed edges of carpet shall be fastened to deck surfaces and shall have trim on the entire length of the exposed edge.&nbsp; Carpet edge trim shall comply with V303.</p>
<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V302.2 Carpet.</strong>&nbsp; Carpets and permanently affixed mats can significantly increase the amount of force (roll resistance) needed to propel a wheelchair over a surface.&nbsp; The firmer the carpeting and backing, the lower the roll resistance.&nbsp; A pile thickness up to ½ inch (13 mm) (measured to the backing, or cushion (e.g., padding) if no backing is provided) is allowed, although a lower pile provides easier wheelchair maneuvering.&nbsp; If a backing or cushion is used, it must be firm.&nbsp; Preferably, carpet cushion should not be used because the soft cushioning increases roll resistance.</p>
