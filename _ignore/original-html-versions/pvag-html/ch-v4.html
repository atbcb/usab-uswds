<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V405.2 Slope.</strong>&nbsp; To accommodate the widest range of users, provide ramps with the least possible running slope and, wherever possible, accompany ramps with stairs for use by those individuals for whom distance presents a greater barrier than steps, e.g., people with heart disease or limited stamina.</p>
