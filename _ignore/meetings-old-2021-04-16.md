Every two months, members of the Access Board hold a meeting, which is primarily open to the public. The meetings typically span three days, with the first two days usually dedicated to committee meetings and presentations and the afternoon of the third day devoted to the agenda of the full Board. The meetings are webcast live, as well as archived. 

The next meeting of the Board will be held **March 10** from **2:00 – 5:00** (ET) and will feature a public forum on accessibility to autonomous vehicles (AVs). This is the first in a [series](https://www.access-board.gov/av/) of four virtual public meetings that will cover different aspects of accessibility to AVs for passengers with mobility, sensory, or cognitive disabilities.

This session will focus on mobility access for entering and exiting AVs and will include guest speakers who will review relevant sources and research. An open dialogue will follow where members of the public can discuss considerations, challenges, and solutions in designing AVs that are inclusive of everyone. Attendees will be able to share comments, suggestions, and information and pose questions. The public is encouraged to attend. Registration is required.  

After the AV Forum and a break, the Board will reconvene to conduct regular business.

During the pandemic, the Board is conducting its meetings remotely using [Zoom for Government](https://zoomgov.com).

Meetings were typically held at the Board’s conference space at 1331 F Street NW, Suite 800, in downtown Washington, DC. The Board usually substitutes one of its meetings each year for a town hall forum outside Washington, DC. For the comfort of all participants and to promote a [fragrance-free](policy/ffe.html) environment, attendees are requested not to use perfume, cologne, or other fragrances.
