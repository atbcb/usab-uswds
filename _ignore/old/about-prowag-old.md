### ABOUT THIS RULEMAKING

Sidewalks, street crossings, and other elements in the public right-of-way can pose challenges to accessibility. The Board's ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines focus mainly on facilities on sites. While they address certain features common to public sidewalks, such as curb ramps, further guidance is necessary to address conditions and constraints unique to public rights-of-way.

The Board is developing new guidelines for public rights-of-way that will address various issues, including access for blind pedestrians at street crossings, wheelchair access to on-street parking, and various constraints posed by space limitations, roadway design practices, slope, and terrain. The new guidelines will cover pedestrian access to sidewalks and streets, including crosswalks, curb ramps, street furnishings, pedestrian signals, parking, and other components of public rights-of-way. The Board's aim in developing these guidelines is to ensure that access for persons with disabilities is provided wherever a pedestrian way is newly built or altered, and that the same degree of convenience, connection, and safety afforded the public generally is available to pedestrians with disabilities. Once these guidelines are adopted by the Department of Justice, they will become enforceable standards under title II of the ADA.

Shared use paths provide a means of off-road transportation and recreation for various users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, skaters, and others, including people with disabilities. In its rulemaking on public rights-of-way and on trails and other outdoor developed areas, comments from the public urged the Board to address access to shared use paths since they are distinct from sidewalks and trails. Shared use paths, unlike most sidewalks, are physically separated from streets by an open space or barrier. They also differ from trails because they are designed not just for recreation purposes but for transportation as well.

In response, the Board is supplementing its rulemaking on public rights-of-way to also cover shared use paths.  The proposed rights-of-way guidelines, which address access to sidewalks, streets, and other pedestrian facilities, provide requirements for pedestrian access routes, including specifications for route width, grade, cross slope, surfaces, and other features. The Board proposes to apply these and other relevant requirements to shared use paths as well. This supplementary rulemaking also would add provisions tailored to shared use paths into the rights-of-way guidelines.

### BACKGROUND

The Board issued proposed guidelines on accessible public rights-of-way for public comment in July 2011.  This proposal includes revisions that were made in response to public comments received on earlier drafts of the rule the Board released in 2002 and 2005. 

The guidelines are based on recommendations from an advisory committee formed by the Board.  The Public Rights-of-Way Access Advisory Committee was composed of 33 members representing disability organizations, public works departments, transportation and traffic engineering groups, design professionals and civil engineers, government agencies, and standards-setting bodies. The committee issued its report, "Building a True Community," in January 2001.

In February 2013, the Board released for public comment a notice to broaden its rulemaking on public rights-of-way to encompass shared use paths used by pedestrians, bicyclists, and others for transportation or recreation.  This proposal would supplement the guidelines being developing for public rights-of-way by applying relevant provisions to shared use paths as well.  It also would add new provisions tailored to shared use paths that cover grade, cross slope, surfaces, and protruding objects.

This proposal incorporates comments from the public received in response to an earlier advance notice on this effort. 

**Advance and Supplemental Rulemaking Notices**

The proposed supplemental provisions on shared use paths are further described in a published notice which includes instructions for submitting comment. The deadline for comments is May 14, 2013.
