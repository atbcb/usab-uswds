Under the ADA, the Department of Transportation (DOT) issues and enforces accessibility standards for transportation vehicles that are based on the Board's [ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) for Transportation Vehicles](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/transportation/vehicles/adaag-for-transportation-vehicles).  These requirements apply to new or remanufactured vehicles covered by the ADA, including:

-   buses and vans
-   rail cars (rapid, light, commuter, intercity, high-speed, and monorail)
-   automated guideway vehicles
-   trams and similar vehicles

DOT's current vehicle standards are consistent with the Board's ADAAG as first published in 1991 and supplemented in 1998 for over-the-road buses. Regulations issued by DOT under the ADA apply these requirements and indicate which vehicles are required to comply.  DOT's ADA regulations also address transportation service and facilities. 

See:  [DOT's Accessibility Specifications for Transportation Vehicles](http://www.fta.dot.gov/civilrights/12325_3884.html) (49 CFR Part 38)
