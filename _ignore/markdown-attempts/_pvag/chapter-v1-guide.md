### V101 Purpose

**V101.1 General.**  This document contains scoping and technical requirements for accessibility to passenger vessels by individuals with disabilities.  The requirements are to be applied during the design, construction, additions to, and alteration of facilities and elements on passenger vessels to the extent required by regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the U.S. Department of Justice under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).

**Advisory V101.1 General.**  In addition to the requirements contained in this document, covered entities must comply under the Americans with Disabilities Act with the regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Justice (see 28 CFR part 35, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in State and Local Government Services, and part 36, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Public Accommodations and in Commercial Facilities) and the U.S. Department of Transportation (see 49 CFR part 37, Transportation Services for Individuals with Disabilities, and 49 CFR part 39, Transportation for Individuals with Disabilities: Passenger Vessels), and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (see 29 CFR part 1630, Regulations to Implement the Equal Employment Provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act).{: .advisory}

**V101.2 Effect on Removal of Barriers in Existing Passenger Vessels.**  This document does not address existing passenger vessels unless altered at the discretion of a covered entity.  The U.S. Department of Justice has authority over existing passenger vessels that are subject to the requirement for removal of barriers under title III of the ADA.  Any determination that this document applies to existing passenger vessels subject to the barrier removal requirement is solely within the discretion of the U.S. Department of Justice and is effective only to the extent required by regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Justice.

### V102 Dimensions for Adults and Children
The technical requirements are based on adult dimensions and anthropometrics.  In addition, this document includes technical requirements based on children's dimensions and anthropometrics for drinking fountains, water closets, toilet compartments, lavatories and sinks, and tables and counters.

### V103 Equivalent Facilitation
Nothing in these requirements prevents the use of designs, products, or technologies as alternatives to those prescribed, provided they result in substantially equivalent or greater accessibility and usability.

**Advisory V103 Equivalent Facilitation.**  The responsibility for demonstrating equivalent facilitation in the event of a challenge rests with the covered entity.  With the exception of transit vehicles and facilities, which are covered by regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation, there is no process for certifying that an alternative design provides equivalent facilitation.{: .advisory}

### V104 Standard Practices

**V104.1 Dimensions.**  Dimensions that are not stated as "maximum" or "minimum" are absolute.

**V104.1.1 Construction and Manufacturing Tolerances.**  All dimensions are subject to conventional industry tolerances except where the requirement is stated as a range with specific minimum and maximum end points.

**Advisory V104.1.1 Construction and Manufacturing Tolerances.**  Conventional industry tolerances recognized by this provision include those for field conditions and those that may be a necessary consequence of a particular manufacturing process.  Recognized tolerances are not intended to apply to design work.{: .advisory}

It is good practice when specifying dimensions to avoid specifying a tolerance where dimensions are absolute.  For example, if this document requires "1½ inches," avoid specifying "1½ inches plus or minus X inches."

Where the requirement states a specified range, such as in Section V609.4 where grab bars must be installed between 33 inches and 36 inches above the deck surface, the range provides an adequate tolerance and therefore no tolerance outside of the range at either end point is permitted.

Where a requirement is a minimum or a maximum dimension that does not have two specific minimum and maximum end points, tolerances may apply.  Where an element is to be installed at the minimum or maximum permitted dimension, such as "15 inches minimum" or "5 pounds maximum", it would not be good practice to specify "5 pounds (plus X pounds) or 15 inches (minus X inches)."  Rather, it would be good practice to specify a dimension less than the required maximum (or more than the required minimum) by the amount of the expected field or manufacturing tolerance and not to state any tolerance in conjunction with the specified dimension.

Specifying dimensions in design in the manner described above will better ensure that facilities, spaces and elements on passenger vessels accomplish the level of accessibility intended by these requirements.  It will also more often produce an end result of strict and literal compliance with the stated requirements and eliminate enforcement difficulties and issues that might otherwise arise.  Information on specific tolerances may be available from industry or trade organizations and published references.

**V104.1.2 Slopes.**  Slopes are measured when the passenger vessel is in a static design condition at full load.

**V104.2 Calculation of Percentages.**  Where the required number of elements or facilities to be provided is determined by calculations of ratios or percentages and remainders or fractions result, the next greater whole number of such elements or facilities shall be provided.  Where the determination of the required size or dimension of an element or facility involves ratios or percentages, rounding down for values less than one half shall be permitted.
