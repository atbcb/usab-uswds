### V201 Application

**V201.1 Scope.**  All areas of newly designed and newly constructed passenger vessels and altered portions of existing passenger vessels shall comply with this document to the extent required by V201.1.

<div class="advisory" markdown="1">
**Advisory V201.1 Scope.**  The requirements are to be applied to all areas of a passenger vessel unless exempted, or where scoping limits the number of spaces and elements required to comply with this document.

Example 1 (Exempted Spaces).  Areas intended for use only by employees are not required to comply with this document (V203.2).

Example 2 (Space Scoping).  Not all clustered single user toilet rooms must comply with this document (V213.2 Exception 4).

Example 3 (Element Scoping).  Operable parts provided in passenger areas must comply with this document (V205.1), but the operable parts in passenger areas intended for use only by employees are not required to comply with this document (V205.1 Exception 1).
</div>

**V201.1.1 Large Vessels.**  Passenger vessels, other than ferries and tenders, permitted to carry more than 150 passengers or more than 49 overnight passengers shall comply with Chapters V 1 through V 10.

**Advisory V201.1.1 Large Vessels.**  For U.S. flag passenger vessels, the US Coast Guard (USCG) determines the number of passengers a vessel is permitted to carry and how many, if any, would be overnight passengers.  This information is recorded in the vessel's certificate of inspection (COI) which is required to be carried onboard the vessel.  Under USCG regulations, it is possible that a vessel could be capable of carrying more passengers then the COI allows.  However, the vessel owner may certificate a vessel to carry fewer than the maximum for business and regulatory reasons.

**V201.1.2 Ferries.**  Ferries permitted to carry more than 99 passengers shall comply with Chapters V 1 through V 10.

**Advisory V201.1.2 Ferries.**  There are passenger vessels which are referred to as water taxis.  If a water taxi meets the definition of a ferry in section V106.5 and is permitted to carry more than 99 passengers, the water taxi is subject to the requirements of this document.

**V201.1.3 Tenders.**  Tenders permitted to carry more than 59 passengers shall comply with Chapters V 1 and V 11.

**V201.2 Application Based on Facility Use.**  Where a facility, room, or space on a passenger vessel contains more than one use, each portion shall comply with the applicable requirements for that use.

**V201.3 Temporary and Permanent Structures.**  These requirements shall apply to temporary and permanent structures on passenger vessels.

**Advisory V201.3 Temporary and Permanent Structures.**  Temporary facilities covered by these requirements include, but are not limited to, reviewing stands, bleacher areas, stages, platforms and daises, fixed furniture systems, wall systems, and exhibit areas.

### V202 Existing Passenger Vessels

**V202.1 General.**  Additions and alterations to existing passenger vessels shall comply with V202.

**V202.2 Additions.**  Each addition to an existing passenger vessel shall comply with the requirements for new construction.

**V202.3 Alterations.**  Where existing elements or spaces are altered, each altered element or space shall comply with the applicable requirements of Chapter 2.

**EXCEPTIONS.  1.**  Where elements or spaces are altered and the circulation path to the altered element or space is not altered, an onboard accessible route shall not be required.

**2.**  In alterations, where compliance with applicable requirements is technically infeasible, the alteration shall comply with the requirements to the maximum extent feasible.

**3.**  In alterations, each alteration shall provide accessibility to the maximum extent feasible where compliance with applicable provisions would result in: (a) an increase in tonnage that changes the passenger vessel's classification from 46 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter K (Small Passenger Vessels Carrying More Than 150 Passengers or With Overnight Accommodations For More Than 49 Passengers) or 46 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter T (Small Passenger Vessels (Under 100 Gross Tons)) to 46 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter H (Passenger Vessels); (b) a violation of the minimum requirements established by the administrative authority for the stability of the vessel; (c) a reduction in the structural integrity or fire resistance of a Class A or B bulkhead (wall) or deck surface; or (d) an increase in power load in excess of the existing power supply.

**Advisory V202.3 Alterations.**  Although covered entities are permitted to limit the scope of an alteration to individual elements, the alteration of multiple elements within a room or space may provide a cost-effective opportunity to make the entire room or space accessible.  Any elements or spaces of the passenger vessel that are required to comply with these requirements must be made accessible within the scope of the alteration, to the maximum extent feasible.  If providing accessibility in compliance with these requirements for people with one type of disability (e.g., people who use wheelchairs) is not feasible, accessibility must still be provided in compliance with the requirements for people with other types of disabilities (e.g., people who have hearing impairments or who have vision impairments) to the extent that such accessibility is feasible.

**V202.3.1 Prohibited Reduction in Access.**  An alteration that decreases or has the effect of decreasing the accessibility of a passenger vessel below the requirements for new construction at the time of the alteration is prohibited.

**V202.3.2 Extent of Application.**  An alteration of an existing element, space, or area of a passenger vessel shall not impose a requirement for accessibility greater than required for new construction.

**V202.4 Alterations to Qualified Historic Passenger Vessels.**  Alterations to a qualified historic passenger vessel shall comply with V202.4.

**EXCEPTION.**  Where the State Historic Preservation Officer or Advisory Council on Historic Preservation determines that compliance with the requirements for onboard accessible routes or toilet facilities would threaten or destroy the historic significance of the passenger vessel, the exceptions for alterations to qualified historic passenger vessels for that element shall be permitted to apply.

### V207 Accessible Means of Escape

**V207.1 General.**  Where the administrative authority requires a passenger vessel to have a means of escape, an accessible means of escape shall be provided and shall provide a substantially equivalent level of protection from hazards as is required by the administrative authority for the means of escape.

**EXCEPTIONS.  1.**  Where a required means of escape is permitted by the administrative authority to include a ladder, window, hatch, or deck scuttle, the corresponding accessible means of escape shall not be required.

**2.**  In alterations, accessible means of escape shall not be required.

**Advisory V207.1 General.**  An administrative authority, such as the U.S. Coast Guard, typically requires passenger vessels subject to its jurisdiction to have one or more means of escape from occupied rooms and spaces connecting to areas where passengers and crew can be evacuated from the vessel (e.g. survival craft embarkation stations).  Generally, a means of escape provides a protected and unobstructed way of travel that may include horizontal components (e.g., doorways and passageways) and vertical components (e.g., stairways).  The means of escape also may include areas of refuge (also known as muster stations or assembly stations) that are designed to protect occupants from the effects of hazards such as fire and smoke.  Passengers may be required to wait in these areas temporarily before they are either permitted to re-enter the affected areas where hazards are no longer a threat or may be routed to areas where they can evacuate the vessel.

The accessible means of escape required by this document must provide passengers who cannot use an inaccessible means of escape with a substantially equivalent level of protection from hazards as is provided passengers who can use an inaccessible means of escape.  Accessible means of escape should be independently usable by passengers with disabilities and should be made up of onboard accessible route components to the extent possible.  However, an accessible means of escape may include inaccessible components where passengers with disabilities would be assisted by crew members.  For example, a stairway or an exit only doorway with coamings may be part of an accessible means of escape but if passengers with disabilities would have to wait for crew assistance at or near the stairway or doorway, the waiting area should be sufficiently protected from hazards in order to provide the occupants a level of protection that is substantially equivalent to the level of protection afforded by the means of escape provided passengers who can use stairs unassisted.  Similarly, elevators and platform lifts may require crew operation during emergencies.  If passengers with disabilities would have to wait at or near elevator or platform lift landings, the waiting area should afford them substantially equivalent protection.  A protected waiting area would not be needed where another equivalent method of protection is provided, such as where passenger vessels are protected by automatic sprinkler systems or areas are open to the weather.

A protected waiting area should be sized to accommodate at least one clear deck space (see V305) for each occupant to be served.  Building codes typically require one such space per 200 occupants based on the occupant load of all accessible spaces to be served by the protected area.  The clear deck spaces should not reduce the required width of any means of escape traveling through the area.  Where more than two clear deck spaces are provided at a single location, each space should be accessible without necessitating travel through more than one adjoining clear deck space.  Protected waiting areas should be equipped with an audible and visible two-way communication system that connects the bridge of the vessel or other space where emergency actions are directed.

Doors to protected waiting areas should be identified by a sign stating "Protected Waiting Area" that includes the International Symbol of Accessibility (see V703.7.2.1).  Signs should be provided in protected waiting areas that contain information on the use of the area during emergencies, including use of the two-way communication system to summon crew assistance, and directions to other accessible means of escape.

### V208 Passenger Vessel Boarding Systems

**V208.1 General.**  Where required by U.S. Department of Transportation or the U.S. Department of Justice, at least one accessible passenger boarding system complying with V402.2 shall connect an entry deck to fixed piers, floating piers, or landside structures.

**Advisory V208.1 General.**  The passenger boarding system may be carried by the vessel or located at landside structures, or partially carried by the vessel and located on land.

### V209 [Reserved]

### V210 Rinsing Showers

**V210.1 General.**  Where provided, rinsing showers shall comply with V608.

**EXCEPTION.**  Where rinsing showers are clustered at a single location, at least one of the rinsing showers shall be required to comply with V608.

**Advisory V210.1 General Exception.**  A "cluster" is a group of rinsing showers proximate to one another, generally, within sight of, or adjacent to, one another.

### V211 Drinking Fountains

**V211.1 General.**  Where provided on a deck, drinking fountains shall be provided in accordance with V211.

**V211.1.1 Entry Deck Location.**  Where passenger drinking fountains are provided on decks not connected by an onboard accessible route to an entry deck as permitted by the exceptions in V206.2.1, passenger drinking fountains complying with V211.2 shall be provided on an entry deck or on a deck connected to an entry deck by an onboard accessible route.

**V211.2 Minimum Number.**  No fewer than two drinking fountains shall be provided.  One drinking fountain shall comply with V602.1 through V602.6 and one drinking fountain shall comply with V602.7.

**EXCEPTION.**  Where a single drinking fountain complies with V602.1 through V602.6 and V602.7 it shall be permitted in place of two separate drinking fountains.

**V211.3 More Than Two.**  Where more than two drinking fountains are provided, 50 percent of the total number of drinking fountains provided shall comply with V602.1 through V602.6 and 50 percent of the total number of drinking fountains provided shall comply with V602.7.

**EXCEPTION.**  Where 50 percent of the drinking fountains yields a fraction, 50 percent shall be permitted to be rounded up or down if the total number of drinking fountains complying with V211 equals 100 percent of drinking fountains.

### V212 Galleys, Pantries, and Sinks

**V212.1 General.**  Where provided, galleys, pantries, and sinks shall comply with V212.

**V212.2 Galleys and Pantries.**  Galleys and pantries shall comply with V804.

**V212.3 Sinks.**  Where sinks are provided, at least 5 percent, but not fewer than one, of each type provided in each room or space required to comply with this document shall comply with V606.

**EXCEPTION.**  Mop or service sinks shall not be required to comply with V212.3.

### V213 Toilet Facilities and Bathing Facilities

**V213.1 General.**  Where passenger toilet facilities and passenger bathing facilities are provided, they shall comply with V213.

**V213.1.1 Entry Deck Location.**  Where passenger toilet rooms are provided on decks not connected by an onboard accessible route to an entry deck as permitted by the exceptions in V206.2.1, at least one passenger toilet room for each sex, or one unisex toilet room, complying with V603 shall be provided on an entry deck or on a deck connected to an entry deck by an onboard accessible route.

**V213.2 Toilet Rooms and Bathing Rooms.**  Where toilet rooms are provided, each toilet room shall comply with V603.  Where bathing rooms are provided, each bathing room shall comply with V603.

**EXCEPTIONS.  1.**  In alterations, where it is technically infeasible to comply with V603, the existing toilet rooms or bathing rooms shall comply to the maximum extent feasible in accordance with V202.3 exception 2, or provide a single unisex toilet room or bathing room complying with V603 that is located in the same area and on the same deck as existing inaccessible toilet or bathing rooms.

**2.**  Where exceptions for alterations to qualified historic passenger vessels are permitted by V202.4, no fewer than one toilet room for each sex or one unisex toilet room complying with V603 shall be provided.

**3.**  Where multiple single user portable toilet or bathing units are clustered at a single location, at least 5 percent of the toilet units and bathing units at each cluster shall be required to comply with V603.  Portable toilet units and bathing units complying with V603 shall be identified by the International Symbol of Accessibility complying with V703.7.2.1.

**4.**  Where multiple single user toilet rooms are clustered at a single location, at least 50 percent of the single user toilet rooms for each use at each cluster shall be required to comply with V603.

**5.**  On high-speed passenger vessels that do not transport overnight passengers, where multiple single user toilet rooms are clustered at a single location, at least 5 percent of the single user toilet rooms for each use at each cluster shall be required to comply with V603.

**Advisory V213.2 Toilet Rooms and Bathing Rooms.**  These requirements allow the use of unisex (or single-user) toilet rooms in alterations when technical infeasibility can be demonstrated.  Unisex toilet rooms benefit people who use opposite sex personal care assistants.  For this reason, it is advantageous to install unisex toilet rooms in addition to accessible single-sex toilet rooms in new facilities.

**Advisory V213.2 Toilet Rooms and Bathing Rooms Exceptions 3 through 5.**  A "cluster" is a group of toilet rooms proximate to one another.  Generally, toilet rooms in a cluster are within sight of, or adjacent to, one another.

| 2001 and over | 55, plus 1 per 100 seats over 2000 seats , or fraction thereof | 1 per 4 receivers, or fraction thereof |

**Advisory V219.3 Receivers.**  Assistive listening systems are generally categorized by their mode of transmission.  There are hard-wired systems and three types of wireless systems: induction loop, infrared, and FM radio transmission.  Where no seats are provided in an assembly area, use the occupant load of the assembly area to determine the seating capacity, and therefore the number of receivers to provide.  Hardwired systems are rarely used anymore.  However, where provided, receiver connections for hard-wired systems should be dispersed throughout the applicable areas.

### V220 Automatic Teller Machines and Fare Machines

**V220.1 General.**  Where automatic teller machines or self-service fare vending, collection, or adjustment machines are provided, at least one of each type provided at each location shall comply with V707.  Where bins are provided for envelopes, waste paper, or other purposes, at least one of each type shall comply with V807.

### V221 Assembly Areas

**V221.1 General.**  Assembly areas shall comply with V221.

**EXCEPTION.**  In passenger vessels that function primarily as ferries, assembly areas shall be permitted to comply with V222.

**Advisory V221.1 General.**  The term assembly area is defined in V106.5 as a portion of a passenger vessel, used for the purpose of entertainment, educational or civic gatherings, or similar purposes.  Assembly areas include, but are not limited to, classrooms, passenger meeting rooms, motion picture houses, auditoria, theaters, and dinner theaters.  Assembly areas should not be confused with the term areas of refuge (also known as assembly stations or muster stations).  Areas of refuge are typically large spaces that are separated from the effects of fire and flooding where passengers can gather in an emergency, and then if necessary be directed to an evacuation station for disembarking a vessel.  An assembly area could be designed and constructed to also function as an area of refuge.  Section V222 addresses transportation seating areas which are defined in V106.5 as an area, other than an assembly area, where fixed seats are provided for passengers.

**V221.2 Wheelchair Spaces.**  Wheelchair spaces shall be provided in assembly areas with fixed seating in accordance with V221.2.

**V221.2.1 Number.**  The number of wheelchair spaces shall be provided in accordance with V221.2.1.

| 151 to 300 | 5 |
| 301 to 500 | 6 |
| 501 to 5000 | 6, plus 1 for each 150, or fraction thereof, between 501 through 5000 |
| 5001 and over | 36, plus 1 for each 200, or fraction thereof, over 5000 |

**V221.2.1.2 Boxes.**  In boxes, wheelchair spaces complying with V802.1 shall be provided in accordance with Table V221.2.1.1 based on the total number of fixed seats provided in boxes.  Wheelchair spaces shall be located in not less than 20 percent of all boxes provided.

**Advisory V221.2.1.2 Boxes.**  The number of wheelchair spaces required in boxes is based on the total number of seats provided in all the boxes and must be located in no fewer than 20% of the boxes.  For example, a performance facility has 20 boxes, each of which contains 10 seats, totaling 200 seats.  In this example, 5 wheelchair spaces would be required, and the wheelchair spaces must be placed in at least 4 of the boxes.  Additionally, because the wheelchair spaces must also meet the dispersion requirements of V221.2.3, the boxes containing these wheelchair spaces cannot all be located in one area unless an exception to the dispersion requirements applies.

**V221.2.2 Integration.**  Wheelchair spaces shall be an integral part of the fixed seating plan.

**Advisory V221.2.2 Integration.**  The requirement that wheelchair spaces be an "integral part of the fixed seating plan" means that wheelchair spaces must be placed within the footprint of the fixed seating area.  Wheelchair spaces cannot be segregated from seating areas.  For example, it would be unacceptable to place only the wheelchair spaces, or only the wheelchair spaces and their associated companion seats, outside the seating areas defined by risers in an assembly area.

**V221.2.3 Dispersion and Fixed Lines of Sight.**  Where seats are arranged to provide lines of sight to fixed screens or performance areas, wheelchair spaces shall provide lines of sight complying with V802.2 and shall comply with V221.2.3.  In providing lines of sight, wheelchair spaces shall be dispersed.  Wheelchair spaces shall provide spectators with choices of seating locations and viewing angles that are substantially equivalent to, or better than, the choices of seating locations and viewing angles available to all other spectators.  Where tables or counters with fixed seats are provided in assembly areas, wheelchair spaces shall be dispersed at the tables and counters.  When the number of wheelchair spaces required by V221.2.1 has been met, further dispersion shall not be required.

**Advisory V221.2.3 Dispersion and Fixed Lines of Sight.**  Consistent with the overall intent of the ADA, individuals who use wheelchairs must be provided equal access so that their experience is substantially equivalent to that of other members of the audience.  Thus, while individuals who use wheelchairs need not be provided with the best seats in the house, neither may they be relegated to the worst.

**V221.2.3.1 Horizontal Dispersion.**  Wheelchair spaces shall be dispersed horizontally.

**EXCEPTIONS.  1.**  Horizontal dispersion shall not be required in assembly areas with 300 or fewer seats provided that the companion seats required by V221.3 and wheelchair spaces are located within the 2nd or 3rd quartile of the total row length.  Intermediate aisles shall be included in determining the total row length.  If the row length in the 2nd and 3rd quartile of a row is insufficient to accommodate the required number of companion seats and wheelchair spaces, the additional companion seats and wheelchair spaces shall be permitted to be located in the 1st and 4th quartile of the row.

**2.**  In row seating, two wheelchair spaces shall be permitted to be located side-by-side.

**Advisory V221.2.3.1 Horizontal Dispersion.**  Horizontal dispersion of wheelchair spaces is the placement of spaces in an assembly facility seating area from side-to-side.

**V221.2.3.2 Vertical Dispersion.**  Wheelchair spaces shall be dispersed vertically at varying distances from the screen or performance area.  In addition, wheelchair spaces shall be located in each balcony or mezzanine that is located on an onboard accessible route which connects to an entry deck.

**EXCEPTIONS.  1.**  Vertical dispersion shall not be required in assembly areas with 300 or fewer seats provided that the wheelchair spaces provide viewing angles that are equivalent to, or better than, the average viewing angle provided in the facility.

**2.**  In bleachers, wheelchair spaces shall not be required to be provided in rows other than rows at points of entry to bleacher seating.

**Advisory V221.2.3.2 Vertical Dispersion.**  When wheelchair spaces are dispersed vertically in an assembly facility they should be placed at different locations within the seating area from front-to-back so that the distance from the screen, stage, or other focal point is varied among wheelchair spaces.

**Advisory V221.2.3.2 Vertical Dispersion Exception 2.**  Points of entry to bleacher seating may include, but are not limited to, cross aisles, and entrance ramps and stairs.  Vertical, center, or side aisles adjoining bleacher seating that are stepped or tiered are not considered entry points.

**V221.2.4 Dispersion and No Fixed Lines of Sight.**  Where seats are not arranged to provide lines of sight to fixed screens or performance areas, wheelchair spaces shall be dispersed throughout the fixed seating plans.  Where tables or counters with fixed seats are provided, wheelchair spaces shall be dispersed at the tables and counters.  When the number of wheelchair spaces required by V221.2.1 has been met, further dispersion shall not be required.

**EXCEPTION.**  Two wheelchair spaces shall be permitted to be located side-by-side.

**Advisory V221.2.4 Dispersion and No Fixed Lines of Sight.**  A tour vessel is an example of a passenger vessel where seats are not installed to provide lines of sight to fixed screen or fixed performance areas.

**V221.3 Companion Seats.**  At least one companion seat complying with V802.3 shall be provided for each wheelchair space required by V221.2.1.

**V221.4 Designated Aisle Seats.**  In assembly areas, at least 5 percent of the total number of fixed aisle seats provided shall comply with V802.4 and shall be the aisle seats located closest to onboard accessible routes.

**Advisory V221.4 Designated Aisle Seats in Assembly Areas.**  When selecting which aisle seats will meet the requirements of V802.4, those aisle seats which are closest to, not necessarily on, accessible routes must be selected first.  For example, an assembly area has two aisles (A and B) serving seating areas with an accessible route connecting to the top and bottom of Aisle A only.  The aisle seats chosen to meet V802.4 must be those at the top and bottom of Aisle A, working toward the middle.  Only when all seats on Aisle A would not meet the 5 percent minimum would seats on Aisle B be designated.

### V222 Transportation Seating Areas

**V222.1 General.**  Transportation seating areas shall comply with V222.

**V222.2 Entry Deck Location.**  Where transportation seating areas are provided on decks not connected by an onboard accessible route to an entry deck as permitted by the exceptions in V206.2.1, at least one transportation seating area complying with V222 shall be provided on an entry deck or on a deck connected to an entry deck by an onboard accessible route.

**V222.3 Wheelchair Spaces.**  The number of wheelchair spaces shall be provided in accordance with V222.3.

**V222.3.1 Number.**  Wheelchair spaces complying with V802.1 shall be provided in accordance with Table V222.3 based on the total number of fixed seats provided in transportation seating areas of the passenger vessel.

**EXCEPTION.**  Where more fixed seats are provided in transportation seating areas than the maximum number of passengers the vessel is permitted to carry, the number of wheelchair spaces shall be permitted to be based on the maximum number of passengers permitted to be carried.

Table V222.3 Number of Wheelchair Spaces
| Number of Seats | Minimum Number of Required Wheelchair Spaces |
| 1 to 60 | 1 |
| 61 to 120 | 2 |

| 501 to 5000 | 6, plus 1 for each 150, or fraction thereof, between 501 through 5000 |
| 5001 and over | 36, plus 1 for each 200, or fraction thereof, over 5000 |

**V222.3.2 Integration.**  Wheelchair spaces shall be an integral part of the fixed seating plans.

**V222.3.3 Dispersion.**  Wheelchair spaces shall be dispersed throughout the fixed seating plans of the transportation seating areas located on an entry deck or connected by an accessible route to an entry deck.  Where tables or counters with fixed seats are provided in transportation seating areas located on an entry deck or connected by an accessible route to an entry deck, wheelchair spaces shall be dispersed at the tables and counters.  When the number of wheelchair spaces required by V222.3.1 has been met, further dispersion shall not be required.

**EXCEPTION.**  Two wheelchair spaces shall be permitted to be located side-by-side.

**Advisory V222.3.3 Dispersion.**  Example.  A ferry has two decks.  The main deck is the only entry deck of the vessel and has a transportation seating area inside the main deck cabin.  The upper (second) deck has a transportation seating area outside and another inside the upper deck cabin.  A total of 149 fixed seats are provided in the three seating areas.  An elevator or other means of vertical access is not required to connect the two decks (see V206.2.1), to meet the dispersion requirements of V222.3.3, the three required wheelchair spaces must be located in the main deck cabin transportation seating area.

### V223 Medical Care Facilities

**V223.1 General.**  Where patient sleeping rooms are provided in medical care facilities, at least 10 percent, but no fewer than one, of the patient sleeping rooms shall provide mobility features complying with V805.

**EXCEPTION.**  Toilet rooms that are part of critical or intensive care patient sleeping rooms shall not be required to comply with V603.
