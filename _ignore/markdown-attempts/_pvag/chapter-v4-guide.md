**V410.9 Edge Protection.**  Edge protection complying with V410.9.1 or V410.9.2 shall be provided on each side of gangway runs and at each side of gangway landings.

**EXCEPTIONS.  1.**  Edge protection shall not be required on the sides of gangway landings serving an adjoining ramp run, gangway run, or stairway.

**2.**  Edge protection shall not be required on the sides of gangway landings having a vertical drop-off of ½ inch (13 mm) maximum within 10 inches (255 mm) horizontally of the minimum landing area specified in V410.7.

**V410.9.1 Extended Deck Surface.**  The deck surface of the gangway run or landing shall extend 12 inches (305 mm) minimum beyond the inside face of a handrail complying with V503.

**Advisory V410.9.1 Extended Deck Surface.**  The extended surface prevents wheelchair casters and crutch tips from slipping off the gangway surface.

**V410.9.2 Curb or Barrier.**  A curb or barrier shall be provided that prevents the passage of a 4 inch (100 mm) diameter sphere, where any portion of the sphere is within 4 inches (100 mm) of the finish deck surface.

**V410.10 Wet Conditions.**  Landings subject to wet conditions shall be designed to prevent the accumulation of water.

### V411 Manually Powered Boarding Lifts

**V411.1 General.**  Manually powered boarding lifts shall comply with V411.

**V411.2 Design Load.**  The design load of the lift shall be at least 600 pounds (272 kg).  Working parts, such as cables, pulleys, and shafts, which would be expected to wear, and upon which the lift depends for support of the load, shall have a safety factor of at least six, based on the ultimate strength of the material.  Nonworking parts, such as platform, frame, and attachment hardware which would not be expected to wear, shall have a safety factor of at least three, based on the ultimate strength of the material.

**V411.3 Controls.**  Where provided, each control for deploying, lowering, raising, and stowing the lift and lowering the roll-off barrier shall require continuous manual pressure by the operators and an inherent design feature or other system shall not allow improper lift sequencing when the lift platform is occupied.  The controls shall allow reversal of the lift operation sequence when the lift is occupied.

**V411.4 Emergency Operation.**  The lift, when occupied, shall incorporate an emergency method of lowering.

**V411.5 Equipment Failure.**  The lift, when occupied, shall have provisions to prevent it from falling any faster than 12 inches/second (305 mm/second) and dropping an occupant in the event of a single failure of any load carrying component.

**V411.6 Platform Barriers.**  The lift platform shall be equipped with barriers to prevent any of the wheels of a wheelchair or mobility aid from rolling off the lift during its operation.

**V411.7 Platform Surface and Size.**  The lift platform surface and size shall comply with V302, V303, and V305.

**EXCEPTION.**  Where the lift platform is approached at the long side, the platform shall be permitted to be 56 inches (1420 mm) wide minimum.

**V411.8 Platform Approaches.**  The approaches to the lift platform, or loading-edge barriers used as approaches, shall comply with V403 or V405.  Transitions from adjacent deck and pier surfaces shall comply with V303.

**EXCEPTIONS.  1.**  Ramped approaches to the lift platform shall be permitted to have running slopes not exceeding 1:8 if the rise of the ramps does not exceed 3 inches (75 mm).

**2.**  Landings specified in V405.7 shall not be required between ramped approaches and the lift platform.

**V411.9 Platform Deflection.**  The lift platform shall not deflect more than 3 degrees in any direction between its unloaded position and its position when loaded with 600 pounds (272 kg) applied through a 26 inch (660 mm) by 26 inch (660 mm) test pallet at the centroid of the lift platform.

**V411.10 Boarding Direction.**  The lift shall permit both inboard and outboard facing of wheelchairs and mobility aids.

**V411.11 Handrails.**  The platform on the lift shall be equipped with handrails on two sides, which move in tandem with the lift, and which shall be graspable and provide support to standees throughout the entire lift operation.  Handrails shall have a usable component 8 inches (205 mm) long minimum, and the top of the gripping surface shall be 30 inches (760 mm) minimum and 38 inches (965 mm) maximum above the platform.  The handrails shall be capable of withstanding a force of 100 pounds (449 N) concentrated at any point on the handrail without permanent deformation of the rail or its supporting structure.  The handrails shall comply with V503.5 through V503.9.
