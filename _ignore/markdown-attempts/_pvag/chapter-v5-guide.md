**V502.6 Handrails.**  Pool stairs shall have handrails complying with V503.

### V503 Handrails

**V503.1 General.**  Handrails provided along walking surfaces complying with V403, at elevators complying with V407 or V408, and at platform lifts complying with V409, shall comply with V503.  Handrails required at ramps complying with V405, gangways complying with V410, and pool stairs complying with V502, shall comply with V503.

**V503.2 Where Required.**  Handrails shall be provided on both sides of pool stairs, gangways, and ramps.

**EXCEPTION.**  In assembly areas, handrails shall not be required on both sides of aisle ramps where a handrail is provided at either side or within the aisle width.

**V503.3 Continuity.**  Handrails shall be continuous within the full length o.  each set of pool stairs, gangway run, or ramp run.  Inside handrails on switchback or dogleg ramps shall be continuous between flights or runs.

**EXCEPTION.**  In assembly areas, handrails on ramps shall not be required to be continuous in aisles serving seating.

**V503.4 Height.**  Top of gripping surfaces of handrails shall be 34 inches (865 mm) minimum and 38 inches (965 mm) maximum vertically above walking surfaces, stair nosings, gangway surfaces, and ramp surfaces.  Handrails shall be at a consistent height above walking surfaces, stair nosings, gangway surfaces, and ramp surfaces.

**EXCEPTION.**  Where the administrative authority requires handrails along walking surfaces with slopes not steeper than 1:20 to be located more than 38 inches (965 mm) above deck surfaces, the handrails shall not be required to comply with V503.4.

**Advisory V503.4 Height.**  The requirements for stair, gangway, and ramp handrails in this document are for adults.  When children are the principal users in a facility (e.g., children's center), a second set of handrails at an appropriate height can assist them and aid in preventing accidents.  A maximum height of 28 inches (710 mm) measured to the top of the gripping surface from the gangway surface, ramp surface or stair nosing is recommended for handrails designed for children.  Sufficient vertical clearance between upper and lower handrails, 9 inches (230 mm) minimum, should be provided to help prevent entrapment.

| [![Figure (a) shows stairs with the top gripping surface of a handrail 34 to 38 inches (865 to 965 mm) above stair nosings.  Figures (b) and (c) show ramps and walking surfaces, respectively.  The top gripping surface of a handrail is 34 to 38 inches (865 to 965 mm) above the surface.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Transportation/Passenger_Vessels/V503-4.jpg)](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Transportation/Passenger_Vessels/V503-4.jpg) |

**V503.6 Gripping Surface.**  Handrail gripping surfaces shall be continuous along their length and shall not be obstructed along their tops or sides.  The bottoms of handrail gripping surfaces shall not be obstructed for more than 20 percent of their length.  Where provided, horizontal projections shall occur 1½ inches (38 mm) minimum below the bottom of the handrail gripping surface.

**EXCEPTIONS.  1.**  Where handrails are provided along walking surfaces with slopes not steeper than 1:20, the bottoms of handrail gripping surfaces shall be permitted to be obstructed along their entire length where they are integral to crash rails or bumper guards.

**2.**  The distance between horizontal projections and the bottom of the gripping surface shall be permitted to be reduced by 1/8 inch (3.2 mm) for each ½ inch (13 mm) of additional handrail perimeter dimension that exceeds 4 inches (100 mm).

**Advisory V503.6 Gripping Surface.**  People with disabilities, older people, and others benefit from continuous gripping surfaces that permit users to reach the fingers outward or downward to grasp the handrail, particularly as the user senses a loss of equilibrium or begins to fall.

| [![A handrail with brackets attached to the bottom surface is shown in cross section.  The horizontal projection of the bracket from the wall is 1½ inches (38 mm) below the bottom of the handrail.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Transportation/Passenger_Vessels/V503-6.jpg)](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Transportation/Passenger_Vessels/V503-6.jpg) |

**V503.10 Handrail Extensions.**  Handrail gripping surfaces shall extend beyond and in the same direction of pool stairs, gangway runs, and ramp runs in accordance with V503.10.

**EXCEPTIONS.  1.**  Extensions shall not be required for continuous handrails at the inside turn of switchback or dogleg gangways, and ramps.

**2.**  In assembly areas, extensions shall not be required for ramp handrails in aisles serving seating where the handrails are discontinuous to provide access to seating and to permit crossovers within aisles.

**3.**  In alterations, full extensions of handrails shall not be required where such extensions would be hazardous due to plan configuration.

**4.**  Where gangways and transition plates connect and are required to have handrails, handrail extensions shall not be required.

**5.**  Where handrail extensions are provided on gangways or transition plates, extensions shall not be required to be horizontal to the landing surface.

**V503.10.1 Top and Bottom Extension at Ramps and Gangways.**  Ramp and gangway handrails shall extend horizontally above the landing for 12 inches (305 mm) minimum beyond the top and bottom of ramp and gangway runs.  Extensions shall return to a wall, guard, or the landing surface, or shall be continuous to the handrail of an adjacent ramp run.
