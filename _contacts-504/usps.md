  A Section 504 complaint must first be submitted orally or in writing to the
  local postal manager, most often the postmaster.  To contact the postmaster or
  other responsible manager, call (800) 275-8777 - (800) ASK-USPS.  If your
  issue is not resolved, you can then reach out to the appropriate USPS Consumer
  and Industry Contact (formerly Consumer Affairs); use the office locator tool
  to find the right contact -
