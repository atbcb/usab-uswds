Alison Sutton Levy leads the Access Board’s team of subject matter experts in delivering technical assistance and training on accessibility standards and guidelines regarding access to facilities, transportation, and information and communication technology for people with disabilities. Levy and her team also collaborate with agency attorneys throughout the agency’s rulemaking efforts.

Levy worked most recently as the Manager of the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Disability Resource Center (DRC); a “one-stop shop” for disability employment and reasonable accommodations services.

Previously, Levy served at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), providing leadership over the recruitment, hiring, advancement, and retention of individuals with disabilities, including reasonable accommodations. She developed and implemented policies, procedures, and strategic plans, and facilitated programs through a diverse team of more than 50 contacts across USDA’s 34 mission areas, agencies, and staff offices.

With over 30 years of experience in the disability profession, Levy has worked toward improving accessibility, and in providing equal opportunity in the post-secondary, public, and private sectors. Levy earned her B.A. in Public Communication from The American University, and her Master’s in Special Education from Johns Hopkins University. She is fluent in American Sign Language.
