shall not be prohibited beneath an element but shall not be considered
as part of the clear space.

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R405.1 General.** Clearances are measured in relation to the usable clear space, not necessarily to the vertical support for an element. When determining clearance under an object, care should be taken to ensure that the space is clear of any obstructions.

#### R405.2 Toe Clearance

##### R405.2.1 General

280 mm (11 in) deep minimum at 230 mm (9 in) above the finish surface,
and 205 mm (8 in) deep minimum at 685 mm (2.25 ft) above the finish

#### R407.2 Running Slope
Ramp runs shall have a running slope between 5
percent minimum and 8.3 percent maximum.

{: .advisory}

##### R407.9.2 Curb or Barrier
A curb or barrier shall be provided that
prevents the passage of a 100 mm (4 in) diameter sphere, where any
portion of the sphere is within 100 mm (4 in) of the finish surface.

in) length.

##### R409.7.1 Circular Cross Section
Handrail gripping surfaces with a
circular cross section shall have an outside diameter of 32 mm (1.25 in)
minimum and 51 mm (2 in) maximum.

##### R409.7.2 Non-Circular Cross Sections
Handrail gripping surfaces
with a non-circular cross section shall have a perimeter dimension of
100 mm (4 in) minimum and 160 mm (6.25 in) maximum, and a cross-section
dimension of 57 mm (2.25 in) maximum.

**Figure R409.7.2 Non-Circular Cross Sections**

![Non-circular cross sections with a perimeter dimension 100 -- 160 mm (
4 -- 6.25 in) and a max cross-section dimension of 57 mm (2.25 in)
](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/409-7-2.jpg)

#### R409.8 Surfaces
Handrail gripping surfaces and any surfaces
adjacent to them shall be free of sharp or abrasive elements and shall
have rounded edges.

#### R409.9 Fittings
Handrails shall not rotate within their fittings.
Where expansion joints are necessary for large spans of handrails, the
expansion joint is permitted to rotate in its fitting.

#### R409.10 Handrail Extensions
Handrail gripping surfaces shall extend
beyond and in the same direction of ramp runs and stair flights in
accordance with R409.10. Extensions shall not be required for continuous
handrails at the inside turn of switchback or dogleg ramps and
stairways. In alterations where handrail extensions would reduce the
clear width required for pedestrian access routes, handrail extensions
shall not be required.

##### R409.10.1 Top and Bottom Extension at Ramps
Ramp handrails shall
extend horizontally above the landing for 305 mm (1.0 ft) minimum beyond
the top and bottom of ramp runs. Extensions shall return to a wall,
guard, or the landing surface, or shall be continuous to the handrail of
an adjacent ramp run.

![Handrail extensions 305 mm (12 in) min long at top and bottom of
ramp](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/409-10-1.jpg)

##### R409.10.2 Top Extension at Stairways
At the top of a stair flight,
handrails shall extend horizontally above the landing for 305 mm (1.0
ft) minimum beginning directly above the first riser nosing. Extensions
shall return to a wall, guard, or the landing surface, or shall be
continuous to the handrail of an adjacent stair flight.

##### R409.10.3 Bottom Extension at Stairways
At the bottom of a stair
flight, handrails shall extend at the slope of the stair flight for a
horizontal distance at least equal to one tread depth beyond the last
riser nosing. Extensions shall return to a wall, guard, or the landing
surface, or shall be continuous to the handrail of an adjacent stair
flight.

Visual characters on signs shall comply with R410.

#### R410.2 Finish and Contrast
Characters and their background shall
have a non-glare finish. Characters shall contrast with their background
with either light characters on a dark background or dark characters on
a light background.

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R410.2.1 Finish and Contrast.** Signs are more legible for pedestrians with low vision when characters contrast as much as possible with their background. Additional factors affecting the ease with which the text can be distinguished from its background include shadows cast by lighting sources, surface glare, and the uniformity of the text and its background colors and textures.

#### R410.3 Case
Characters shall be uppercase or lowercase or a
combination of both.

minimum and 110 percent maximum of the height of the uppercase letter
"I".

Minimum character height shall comply with
Table R410.6. Viewing distance shall be measured as the horizontal
distance between the character and an obstruction preventing further
approach towards the sign. Character height shall be based on the
uppercase letter "I".
