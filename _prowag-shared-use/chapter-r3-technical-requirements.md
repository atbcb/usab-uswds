{: .advisory}
**Advisory R302.3 Continuous Width.** The continuous clear width requirements in R302.3 apply to sidewalks and other pedestrian circulation paths, pedestrian street crossings and at-grade rail crossings, and pedestrian overpasses and underpasses and similar structures (see R302.2). Clear width requirements are contained in R304.5.1 for curb ramps and blended transitions, and in R407.4 for ramps. Where sidewalks are wider than 1.2 m (4.0 ft), only a portion of the sidewalk is required to comply with the requirements in R302.3 through R302.7. Additional maneuvering space should be provided at turns or changes in direction, transit stops, recesses and alcoves, building entrances, and along curved or angled routes, particularly where the grade exceeds 5 percent. R210 prohibits street furniture and other objects from reducing the minimum clear width of pedestrian access routes.

##### R302.3.1 Medians and Pedestrian Refuge Islands
The clear width of pedestrian access routes within medians and pedestrian refuge islands
shall be 1.5 m (5.0 ft) minimum.

##### R302.3.2 Shared Use Paths

#### R302.5 Grade
The grade of pedestrian access routes shall comply with R302.5.

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R302.5 Grade.** The grade requirements in R302.5 apply to sidewalks and other pedestrian circulation paths, pedestrian street crossings and at-grade rail crossings, and pedestrian overpasses and underpasses and similar structures (see R302.2). The grade of the pedestrian access route is measured parallel to the direction of pedestrian travel. Running slope requirements are contained in R304.2.2 for perpendicular curb ramps, in R304.3.2 for parallel curb ramps, in R304.4.1 for blended transitions, and in R407.2 for ramps.

##### R302.5.1 Within Street or Highway Right-of-Way
Except as provided in R302.5.3, where pedestrian access routes are contained within a street or highway right-of-way, the grade of pedestrian access routes shall not exceed the general grade established for the adjacent street or highway.

##### R302.5.2 Not Within Street or Highway Right-of-Way
Where pedestrian access routes are not contained within a street or highway right-of-way, the grade of pedestrian access routes shall be 5 percent maximum.

##### R302.5.3 Within Pedestrian Street Crossings
Where pedestrian access routes are contained within a pedestrian street crossing, the grade of pedestrian access routes shall be 5 percent maximum.

##### R302.5.4 Physical Constraints
Where compliance with R302.5.1 or R302.5.2 is not practicable due to existing terrain or infrastructure, right-of-way availability, a notable natural feature, or similar existing physical constraints, compliance is required to the extent practicable.

##### R302.5.5 Regulatory Constraints
Where compliance with R302.5.1 or R302.5.2 is precluded by federal, state, or local laws the purpose of which is to preserve threatened or endangered species; the environment; or archaeological, cultural, historical, or significant natural features, compliance is required to the extent practicable.


#### R302.6 Cross Slope
Except as provided in R302.6.1 and R302.6.2, the
cross slope of pedestrian access routes shall be 2 percent maximum.

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R302.6 Cross Slope.** The cross slope requirements in R302.6 apply to sidewalks and other pedestrian circulation paths, pedestrian street crossings and at-grade rail crossings, and pedestrian overpasses and underpasses and similar structures (see R302.2). The cross slope of the pedestrian access route is measured perpendicular to the direction of pedestrian travel. Cross slope requirements are contained in R304.5.3 for curb ramps and blended transitions, and in R407.3 for ramps.

##### R302.6.1 Pedestrian Street Crossings Without Yield or Stop Control
Where pedestrian access routes are contained within pedestrian street crossings without yield or stop control, the cross slope of the
pedestrian access route shall be 5 percent maximum.

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R302.6.1 Pedestrian Street Crossings Without Yield or Stop Control.** Pedestrian street crossings without yield or stop control are crossings where there is no yield or stop sign, or where there is a traffic signal that is designed for the green phase. At pedestrian street crossings without yield or stop control, vehicles can proceed through the intersection without slowing or stopping. Where pedestrian access routes are contained within pedestrian street crossings with yield or stop control, the cross slope of the pedestrian access route must be 2 percent maximum (see R302.6). At pedestrian street crossings with yield or stop control, vehicles slow or stop before proceeding through the intersection.

##### R302.6.2 Midblock Pedestrian Street Crossings
Where pedestrian access routes are contained within midblock pedestrian street crossings,
the cross slope of the pedestrian access route shall be permitted to
equal the street or highway grade.

#### R302.7 Surfaces
The surfaces of pedestrian access routes and elements and spaces required to comply with R302.7 that connect to
pedestrian access routes shall be firm, stable, and slip resistant and
shall comply with R302.7.

<div class="advisory" markdown="1">
**Advisory R302.7 Surfaces.** The surface requirements in R302.7 apply to sidewalks and other pedestrian circulation paths, pedestrian street crossings and at-grade rail crossings, pedestrian overpasses and underpasses and similar structures, and curb ramps and blended transitions (see R302.2). The surface requirements in R302.7 also apply to surfaces at the following accessible elements and spaces that connect to pedestrian access routes:

- Clear spaces (see R404.2), including clear spaces at operable parts (see R403.2) such as accessible pedestrian signals and pedestrian pushbuttons (see R209), clear spaces at street furniture such as benches (see R212.6), and clear spaces within transit shelters (see R308.2);
- Boarding and alighting areas and boarding platforms at transit stops (see R308.1.3.1);
-   Access aisles at accessible parking spaces (see R309.2.1 and R309.3) and accessible passenger loading zones (see R310.3.4); and
- Ramp runs and landings (see R407.7).
</div>

##### R302.7.1 Vertical Alignment
Vertical alignment shall be generally planar within pedestrian access routes (including curb ramp runs, blended transitions, turning spaces, and gutter areas within pedestrian
access routes) and surfaces at other elements and spaces required to
comply with R302.7 that connect to pedestrian access routes. Grade
breaks shall be flush. Where pedestrian access routes cross rails at
grade, the pedestrian access route surface shall be level and flush with
the top of rail at the outer edges of the rails, and the surface between
the rails shall be aligned with the top of rail.

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R302.7.1 Vertical Alignment.** Pedestrian access route surfaces must be generally planar and smooth. Surfaces should be chosen for easy rollability. Surfaces that are heavily textured, rough, or chamfered and paving systems consisting of individual units that cannot be laid in plane will greatly increase rolling resistance and subject pedestrians who use wheelchairs, scooters, and rolling walkers to the stressful and often painful effects of vibration. Such materials should be reserved for borders and decorative accents located outside of or only occasionally crossing the pedestrian access route. Surfaces should be designed, constructed, and maintained according to appropriate industry standards, specifications, and recommendations for best practice.

##### R302.7.2 Vertical Surface Discontinuities
Vertical surface discontinuities shall be 13 mm (0.5 in) maximum. Vertical surface
discontinuities between 6.4 mm (0.25 in) and 13 mm (0.5 in) shall be
beveled with a slope not steeper than 50 percent. The bevel shall be
applied across the entire vertical surface discontinuity.

**Figure R302.7.2 Vertical Surface Discontinuities**

![Vertical surface discontinuity 6.4 mm (1/4 inch) max with straight
edge and vertical surface discontinuity 6.4 -- 13 mm (1/4 -- 1 /2 inch)
max with 1:2 beveled
edge](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/302-7-2.jpg)

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R302.7.2 Vertical Surface Discontinuities.** The allowance for vertical surface discontinuities is for occasional expansion joints and objects such as utility covers, vault frames, and gratings that cannot be located in another portion of the sidewalk outside the pedestrian access route. However, objects such as utility covers, vault frames, and gratings should not be located on curb ramp runs, blended transitions, turning spaces, or gutter areas within the pedestrian access route. This may not always be possible in alterations, but should be avoided wherever possible. Vertical surface discontinuities between unit pavers should be minimized.

##### R302.7.3 Horizontal Openings
Horizontal openings in gratings and joints shall not permit passage of a sphere more than 13 mm (0.5 in) in
diameter. Elongated openings in gratings shall be placed so that the
long dimension is perpendicular to the dominant direction of travel.

**Figure R302.7.3 Horizontal Openings**

![Elongated openings, such as in a grating, are shown in plan view with
openings 13 mm (1 /2 inch) maximum in one dimension. The other dimension
is longer (unspecified) and is perpendicular to the dominant direction
of
travel.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/302-7-3.jpg)

##### R302.7.4 Flangeway Gaps
Flangeway gaps at pedestrian at-grade rail crossings shall be 64 mm (2.5 in) maximum on non-freight rail track and
75 mm (3 in) maximum on freight rail track.

**Figure R302.7.4 Flangeway Gaps**

![Flangeway gaps shown 64 mm (2.5 in) max. (figure a) and 75 mm (3 in)
max (figure
b)](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/302-7-4.jpg)

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R302.7.4 Flangeway Gaps.** Flangeway gaps are necessary to allow the passage of train wheel flanges. Flangeway gaps pose a potential hazard to pedestrians who use wheelchairs because the gaps can entrap the wheelchair casters.

### R303 Alternate Pedestrian Access Routes 
(See R205)

### R304 Curb Ramps and Blended Transitions

#### R304.1 General
Curb ramps and blended transitions shall comply with R304.


<div class="advisory" markdown="1">
**Advisory R304.1 General.** There are two types of curb ramps:

- Perpendicular curb ramps have a running slope that cuts through or is built up to the curb at right angles or meets the gutter break at right angles where the curb is curved. On large corner radiuses, it will be necessary to indent the gutter break on one side of the curb ramp in order for the curb ramp to meet the gutter break at right angles.
- Parallel curb ramps have a running slope that is in-line with the direction of sidewalk travel and lower the sidewalk to a level turning space where a turn is made to enter the pedestrian street crossing.

Perpendicular curb ramps can be provided where the sidewalk is at least 3.7 m (12.0 ft) wide. Parallel curb ramps can be provided where the sidewalk is at least 1.2 m (4.0 ft) wide. Parallel and perpendicular curb ramps can be combined. A parallel curb ramp is used to lower the sidewalk to a mid-landing and a short perpendicular curb ramp connects the landing to the street. Combination curb ramps can be provided where the sidewalk is at least 1.8 m (6.0 ft) wide.

Blended transitions are raised pedestrian street crossings, depressed corners, or similar connections between pedestrian access routes at the level of the sidewalk and the level of the pedestrian street crossing that have a grade of 5 percent or less. Blended transitions are suitable for a range of sidewalk conditions.
</div>

#### R304.2 Perpendicular Curb Ramps
Perpendicular curb ramps shall comply with R304.2 and R304.5.

##### R304.2.1 Turning Space
A turning space 1.2 m (4.0 ft) minimum by
1.2 m (4.0 ft) minimum shall be provided at the top of the curb ramp and
shall be permitted to overlap other turning spaces and clear spaces.
Where the turning space is constrained at the back-of-sidewalk, the
turning space shall be 1.2 m (4.0 ft) minimum by 1.5 m (5.0 ft) minimum.
The 1.5 m (5.0 ft) dimension shall be provided in the direction of the
ramp run.

**Figure R304.2.1 Turning Space**

![Turning space 1.2 m (4.0 ft) min by 1.2 m (4.0 ft) min at top of curb
ramps or 1.2 m (4.0 ft) wide min by 1.5 m (5.0 ft) long min where space
is constrained at the back-of-sidewalk
](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/304-2-1.jpg)

##### R304.2.2 Running Slope
The running slope of the curb ramp shall cut through or shall be built up to the curb at right angles or shall meet
the gutter grade break at right angles where the curb is curved. The
running slope of the curb ramp shall be 5 percent minimum and 8.3
percent maximum but shall not require the ramp length to exceed 4.5 m
(15.0 ft). The running slope of the turning space shall be 2 percent
maximum.

##### R304.2.3 Flared Sides
Where a pedestrian circulation path crosses the curb ramp, flared sides shall be sloped 10 percent maximum, measured
parallel to the curb line.

**Figure 304.2.3 Flared Sides**

![Flared sides sloped 10 percent max at curb ramps where pedestrian
circulation paths cross the ramp (returned curbs shown where protected
from pedestrian cross
traffic](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/304-2-3.jpg)

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R304.2.3 Flared Sides.** The flared sides are part of the pedestrian circulation path, but are not part of the pedestrian access route. Curb ramps whose sides have returned curbs provide useful directional cues where they are aligned with the pedestrian street crossing and are protected from cross travel by landscaping, street furniture, chains, fencing, or railings.

#### R304.3 Parallel Curb Ramps
Parallel curb ramps shall comply with
R304.3 and R304.5.

##### R304.3.1 Turning Space
A turning space 1.2 m (4.0 ft) minimum by
1.2 m (4.0 ft) minimum shall be provided at the bottom of the curb ramp
and shall be permitted to overlap other turning spaces and clear spaces.
If the turning space is constrained on 2 or more sides, the turning
space shall be 1.2 m (4.0 ft) minimum by 1.5 m (5.0 ft). The 1.5 m (5.0
ft) dimension shall be provided in the direction of the pedestrian
street crossing.

**Figure R304.3.1 Turning Space**

![Turning space 1.2 m (4.0 ft) min by 1.2 m (4.0 ft) min at the bottom
of curb ramp or 1.2 m (4.0 ft) wide min by 1.5 m (5.0 ft) long min where
the space is constrained on 2 or more sides
](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/304-3-1.jpg)

##### R304.3.2 Running Slope
The running slope of the curb ramp shall be in-line with the direction of sidewalk travel. The running slope of the
curb ramp shall be 5 percent minimum and 8.3 percent maximum but shall
not require the ramp length to exceed 4.5 m (15.0 ft) minimum. The
running slope of the turning space shall be 2 percent maximum.

#### R304.4 Blended Transitions
Blended transitions shall comply with R304.4 and R304.5.

##### R304.4.1 Running Slope
The running slope of blended transitions shall be 5 percent maximum.

**Figure R304.4.1 Running Slope**

![Curb ramp running slope 5% max
](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/304-4-1.jpg)

#### R304.5 Common Requirements
Curb ramps and blended transitions shall comply with R304.5.

##### R304.5.1 Width
The width of curb ramps and blended transitions shall comply with 304.5.1.1 or 304.5.1.2, as applicable. If provided, flared sides of curb ramp runs and blended transitions shall be located outside the width of the curb ramp run or blended transition.

###### R304.5.1.1 Pedestrian Circulation Paths Other Than Shared Use Paths
In pedestrian circulation paths other than shared use paths, the clear width of curb ramp runs, blended transitions, and turning spaces shall be 1.2 m (4.0 ft) minimum.

###### R304.5.1.2 Shared Use Paths
In shared use paths, the width of curb ramp runs and blended transitions shall be equal to the width of the shared use path.

**Figure R304.5.1 Width**

![Width of curb ramp 1.2 m (4 ft) min
](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/304-5-1.jpg)

##### R304.5.2 Grade Breaks
Grade breaks at the top and bottom of curb ramp runs shall be perpendicular to the direction of the ramp run. Grade
breaks shall not be permitted on the surface of ramp runs and turning
spaces. Surface slopes that meet at grade breaks shall be flush.

**Figure R304.5.2 Grade Breaks**

![Grade break at curb ramp shown perpendicular to direction of travel
](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/304-5-2.jpg)

##### R304.5.3 Cross Slope
The cross slope of curb ramps, blended
transitions, and turning spaces shall be 2 percent maximum. At
pedestrian street crossings without yield or stop control and at
midblock pedestrian street crossings, the cross slope shall be permitted
to equal the street or highway grade.

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R304.5.3 Cross Slope.** Pedestrian street crossings without yield or stop control are crossings where there is no yield or stop sign, or where there is a traffic signal that is designed for the green phase. At pedestrian street crossings without yield or stop control, vehicles can proceed through the intersection without slowing or stopping.

##### R304.5.4 Counter Slope
The counter slope of the gutter or street at the foot of curb ramp runs, blended transitions, and turning spaces
shall be 5 percent maximum.

##### R304.5.5 Clear Space
Beyond the bottom grade break, a clear space 1.2 m (4.0 ft) minimum by 1.2 m (4.0 ft) minimum shall be provided
within the width of the pedestrian street crossing and wholly outside
the parallel vehicle travel lane.

**Figure R304.5.5 Clear Space**

![Clear space 1.2 m (4 ft) min by 1.2 m (4 ft) min at the bottom of curb
ramp beyond grade break located within width of pedestrian street
crossing](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/304-5-5.jpg)

### R305 Detectable Warning Surfaces

#### R305.1 General
Detectable warning surfaces shall consist of
truncated domes aligned in a square or radial grid pattern and shall
comply with R305.

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R305.1 Dome Size.** Where the truncated domes are arrayed radially, they may differ in diameter and center-to-center spacing within the ranges specified in R305.1.1 and R305.1.2.

##### R305.1.1 Dome Size
The truncated domes shall have a base diameter of 23 mm (0.9 in) minimum and 36 mm (1.4 in) maximum, a top diameter of
50 percent of the base diameter minimum and 65 percent of the base
diameter maximum, and a height of 5 mm (0.2 in).

**Figure R305.1.1 Dome Size**

![Truncated dome in elevation shown with a base diameter of 23 mm (0.9
in) min to 36 mm (1.4 in) max, a top diameter 50% to 65% of the base
diameter, and a height of 5 mm (0.2 in)
](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/305-1-1.jpg)

##### R305.1.2 Dome Spacing
The truncated domes shall have a
center-to-center spacing of 41 mm (1.6 in) minimum and 61 mm (2.4 in)
maximum, and a base-to-base spacing of 17 mm (0.65 in) minimum, measured
between the most adjacent domes.

**Figure R305.1.2 Dome Spacing**

![Truncated domes in plan view with a center-to-center spacing of 41 mm
(1.6 in) min and 61 mm (2.4 in) max, and a base-to-base spacing of 17 mm
(0.65 in) min, measured between the most adjacent
domes](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/305-1-2.jpg)

##### R305.1.3 Contrast
Detectable warning surfaces shall contrast
visually with adjacent gutter, street or highway, or pedestrian access
route surface, either light-on-dark or dark-on-light.

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R305.1.3 Contrast.** Visual contrast may be provided on the full surface of the curb ramp but should not extend to flared sides. Visual contrast also helps pedestrians who use wheelchairs to locate the curb ramp from the other side of the street.

##### R305.1.4 Size
Detectable warning surfaces shall extend 610 mm (2.0
ft) minimum in the direction of pedestrian travel. At curb ramps and
blended transitions, detectable warning surfaces shall extend the full
width of the ramp run (excluding any flared sides), blended transition,
or turning space. At pedestrian at-grade rail crossings not located
within a street or highway, detectable warnings shall extend the full
width of the crossing. At boarding platforms for buses and rail
vehicles, detectable warning surfaces shall extend the full length of
the public use areas of the platform. At boarding and alighting areas at
sidewalk or street level transit stops for rail vehicles, detectable
warning surfaces shall extend the full length of the transit stop.

**Figure R305.1.4 Size**

![Detectable warning area 610 mm (24 in) deep shown extending the full
width of a perpendicular curb ramp and curb ramp with a returned curb
and the full width of landing at parallel curb ramp
](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/305-1-4.jpg)

#### R305.2 Placement
The placement of detectable warning surfaces shall
comply with R305.2.

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R305.2 Placement.** Some detectable warning products require a concrete border for proper installation. The concrete border should not exceed 51 mm (2 in). Where the back of curb edge is tooled to provide a radius, the border dimension should be measured from the end of the radius.

##### R305.2.1 Perpendicular Curb Ramps
On perpendicular curb ramps,
detectable warning surfaces shall be placed as follows:

1. Where the ends of the bottom grade break are in front of the back of curb, detectable warning surfaces shall be placed at the back of curb.
2. Where the ends of the bottom grade break are behind the back of curb and the distance from either end of the bottom grade brake to the back of curb is 1.5 m (5.0 ft) or less, detectable warning surfaces shall be placed on the ramp run within one dome spacing of the bottom grade break.
3. Where the ends of the bottom grade break are behind the back of curb and the distance from either end of the bottom grade brake to the back of curb is more than 1.5 m (5.0 ft), detectable warning surfaces shall be placed on the lower landing at the back of curb.

**Figure R305.2.1 Perpendicular Curb Ramps**

![Detectable warnings located on ramp run where both ends of the bottom
grad break are less than 1.5 m (5 ft) from back of curb and located on
the lower landing at the back of curb where one or both ends of the
bottom grade break are more than 1.5 m (5 ft) from back of
curb](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/305-2-1.jpg)

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R305.2.1 Perpendicular Curb Ramps.** Detectable warning surfaces are intended to provide a tactile equivalent underfoot of the visible curb line. If detectable warning surfaces are placed too far from the curb line because of a large curb radius, the location may compromise effective crossing. Detectable warning surfaces should not be placed on paving or expansion joints. The rows of truncated domes in detectable warning surfaces should be aligned perpendicular to the grade break between the ramp run and the street so pedestrians who use wheelchairs can "track" between the domes. Where detectable warning surfaces are provided on a surface with a slope that is less than 5 percent, dome orientation is less critical.

##### R305.2.2 Parallel Curb Ramps
On parallel curb ramps, detectable
warning surfaces shall be placed on the turning space at the flush
transition between the street and sidewalk.

**Figure R305.2.2 Parallel Curb Ramps**

![Detectable warning located at the back of curb along the bottom
landing between parallel
ramps](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/305-2-2.jpg)

##### R305.2.3 Blended Transitions
On blended transitions, detectable
warning surfaces shall be placed at the back of curb. Where raised
pedestrian street crossings, depressed corners, or other level
pedestrian street crossings are provided, detectable warning surfaces
shall be placed at the flush transition between the street and the
sidewalk.

**Figure R305.2.3 Blended Transitions**

![Detectable warning at raised crossing located back of curb along the
entire transition between street and
sidewalk](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/305-2-3.jpg)

##### R305.2.4 Pedestrian Refuge Islands
At cut-through pedestrian refuge
islands, detectable warning surfaces shall be placed at the edges of the
pedestrian island and shall be separated by a 610 mm (2.0 ft) minimum
length of surface without detectable warnings.

**Figure R 305.2.4 Pedestrian Refuge Island**

![Detectable warnings at pedestrian refuge island 1.8 m (ft) min wide
that are separated by non-detectable warning surface 610 mm (2 ft) min
long illustrated for cut-through route, route with aligned curb ramps on
both sides, and route with offset curb ramps on both sides
](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/305-2-4.jpg)

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R305.2.4 Pedestrian Refuge Islands.** The edges of cut-through pedestrian refuge islands can provide useful cues to the direction of the crossing.

##### R305.2.5 Pedestrian At-Grade Rail Crossings
At pedestrian at-grade
rail crossings not located within a street or highway, detectable
warning surfaces shall be placed on each side of the rail crossing. The
edge of the detectable warning surface nearest the rail crossing shall
be 1.8 m (6.0 ft) minimum and 4.6 m (15.0 ft) maximum from the
centerline of the nearest rail. Where pedestrian gates are provided,
detectable warning surfaces shall be placed on the side of the gates
opposite the rail.

**Figure R305.2.5 Pedestrian At-Grade Rail Crossings**

![At pedestrian at-grade rail crossing, detectable warnings shown
located 1.8 -- 4.6 m (6 -- 15 ft) from the centerline of the nearest
rail and, on other side, on the side of pedestrian gate opposite the
rail](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/305-2-5.jpg)

##### R305.2.6 Boarding Platforms
At boarding platforms for buses and
rail vehicles, detectable warning surfaces shall be placed at the
boarding edge of the platform.

##### R305.2.7 Boarding and Alighting Areas
At boarding and alighting
areas at sidewalk or street level transit stops for rail vehicles,
detectable warning surfaces shall be placed at the side of the boarding
and alighting area facing the rail vehicles.

### R306 Pedestrian Street Crossings

#### R306.1 General
Pedestrian street crossings shall comply with R306.

#### R306.2 Pedestrian Signal Phase Timing
All pedestrian signal phase
timing shall comply with section 4E.06 of the MUTCD (incorporated by
reference, see R104.2 and shall be based on a pedestrian clearance time
that is calculated using a pedestrian walking speed of 1.1 m/s (3.5
ft/s) or less.

#### R306.3 Roundabouts
Where pedestrian facilities are provided at
roundabouts, they shall comply with R306.3.

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R306.3 Roundabouts.** Pedestrian street crossings at roundabouts can be difficult for pedestrians who are blind or have low vision to identify because the crossings are located off to the side of the pedestrian circulation path around the street or highway. The continuous traffic flow at roundabouts removes many of the audible cues that pedestrians who are blind use to navigate pedestrian street crossings. Water fountains and other features that produce background noise should not be placed in the middle island of a roundabout because pedestrians who are blind use auditory cues to help detect gaps in traffic. Multi-lane pedestrian street crossings at roundabouts involve an increased risk of pedestrian exposure to accident.

##### R306.3.1 Separation
Where sidewalks are flush against the curb and
pedestrian street crossing is not intended, a continuous and detectable
edge treatment shall be provided along the street side of the sidewalk.
Detectable warning surfaces shall not be used for edge treatment. Where
chains, fencing, or railings are used for edge treatment, they shall
have a bottom edge 380 mm (15 in) maximum above the sidewalk.

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R306.3.1 Separation.** Carefully delineated pedestrian street crossing approaches with plantings or other defined edges provide effective non-visual cues for identifying pedestrian street crossings at roundabouts. European and Australian roundabouts provide a 610 mm (24 inch) width of tactile surface treatment from the centerline of the curb ramp or blended transition across the full width of the sidewalk to provide an underfoot cue for identifying pedestrian street crossings. Detectable warning surfaces should not be used to guide pedestrians who are blind or have low vision to pedestrian street crossings because detectable warning surfaces indicate the flush transition between the sidewalk and the street or highway. Schemes that remove cyclists from the street or highway by means of a ramp that angles from the curb lane to the sidewalk and then provide re-entry by means of a similar ramp beyond pedestrian street crossings can provide false cues to pedestrians who are using the edge of the sidewalk for wayfinding about the location of pedestrian street crossings.

##### R306.3.2 Pedestrian Activated Signals
At roundabouts with
multi-lane pedestrian street crossings, a pedestrian activated signal
complying with R209 shall be provided for each multi-lane segment of
each pedestrian street crossing, including the splitter island. Signals
shall clearly identify which pedestrian street crossing segment the
signal serves.

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R306.3.2 Pedestrian Activated Signals.** Roundabouts with single-lane approach and exit legs are not required to provide pedestrian activated signals. Pedestrian activated signals must comply with the requirements for accessible pedestrian signals and pedestrian pushbuttons (see R209). Pedestrian activated signals installed at splitter islands should be carefully located and separated so that signal spillover does not give conflicting information about which pedestrian street crossing has the WALK indication displayed. Pedestrian Hybrid Beacons can be used at roundabouts (see MUTCD sections 4F.01 through 4F.03). Pedestrian Hybrid Beacons are traffic signals that consist of a yellow signal centered below two horizontally aligned red signals. The signals are normally not illuminated. The signals are initiated only upon pedestrian activation and can be timed to minimize the interruption of traffic. The signals cease operation after the pedestrian clears the crosswalk. When activated by a pedestrian, the following signals are displayed to drivers: a flashing yellow signal, then a steady yellow signal, then two steady red signals during the pedestrian walk interval, and then alternating flashing red signals during the pedestrian clearance interval. The following signals are displayed to pedestrians: a steady upraised hand (symbolizing DON'T WALK) when the flashing or steady yellow signal is operating, then a walking person (symbolizing WALK) when the steady red signals are operating, and then a flashing upraised hand (symbolizing DON'T WALK) when the alternating flashing red signals are operating.

#### R306.4 Channelized Turn Lanes at Roundabouts
At roundabouts with
pedestrian street crossings, pedestrian activated signals complying with
R209 shall be provided at pedestrian street crossings at multi-lane
channelized turn lanes.

#### R306.5 Channelized Turn Lanes at Other Signalized Intersections
At signalized intersections other than roundabouts with pedestrian street
crossings, pedestrian activated signals complying with R209 shall be
provided at pedestrian street crossings at multi-lane channelized turn
lanes.

### R308 Transit Stops and Transit Shelters

#### R308.1 Transit Stops
Transit stops shall comply with R308.1.

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R308.1 Transit Stops.** Transit stops should be located so that there is a level and stable surface for boarding vehicles. Locating transit stops at signalized intersections increases the usability for pedestrians with disabilities. Where security bollards are installed at transit stops, they must not obstruct the clear space at boarding and alighting areas or reduce the required clear width at pedestrian access routes (see R210).

##### R308.1.1 Boarding and Alighting Areas
Boarding and alighting areas at sidewalk or street level transit stops shall comply with R308.1.1 and
