<p class="advisory">Advisory F235.2 Boat Slips.&nbsp; The requirement for boat slips also applies to piers where boat slips are not demarcated.&nbsp; For example, a single pier 25 feet (7620 mm) long and 5 feet (1525 mm) wide (the minimum width specified by Section 1003.3) allows boats to moor on three sides.&nbsp; Because the number of boat slips is not demarcated, the total length of boat slip edge (55 feet, 17 m) must be used to determine the number of boat slips provided (two).&nbsp; This number is based on the specification in Section F235.2 that each 40 feet (12 m) of boat slip edge, or fraction thereof, counts as one boat slip.&nbsp; In this example, Table F235.2 would require one boat slip to be <cite title="A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with this part.">accessible</cite>.</p>

<p class="advisory">Advisory F235.2.1 Dispersion.&nbsp; Types of boat slips are based on the size of the boat slips; whether single berths or double berths, shallow water or deep water, transient or longer-term lease, covered or uncovered; and whether slips are equipped with features such as telephone, water, electricity or cable connections.&nbsp; The term "boat slip" is intended to cover any pier area other than launch ramp boarding piers where recreational boats are moored for purposes of berthing, embarking, or disembarking.&nbsp; For example, a fuel pier may contain boat slips, and this type of short term slip would be included in determining compliance with F235.2.</p>

<p class="first">Advisory F240.2.1 Ground Level Play Components.&nbsp; Examples of ground level play components may include spring rockers, swings, diggers, and stand-alone slides.&nbsp; When distinguishing between the different types of ground level play components, consider the general experience provided by the play component.&nbsp; Examples of different types of experiences include, but are not limited to, rocking, swinging, climbing, spinning, and sliding.&nbsp; A spiral slide may provide a slightly different experience from a straight slide, but sliding is the general experience and therefore a spiral slide is not considered a different type of play component from a straight slide.</p>
<p>Ground level play components accessed by children with disabilities must be integrated into the play area.&nbsp; Designers should consider the optimal layout of ground level play components accessed by children with disabilities to foster interaction and socialization among all children. Grouping all ground level play components accessed by children with disabilities in one location is not considered integrated.</p>
<p>Where a stand-alone slide is provided, an <cite title="A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with this part.">accessible</cite> route must connect the base of the stairs at the entry point to the exit point of the slide.&nbsp; A ramp or transfer system to the top of the slide is not required.&nbsp; Where a sand box is provided, an <cite title="A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with this part.">accessible</cite> route must connect to the border of the sand box.&nbsp; Accessibility to the sand box would be enhanced by providing a transfer system into the sand or by providing a raised sand table with knee clearance complying with 1008.4.3.</p>
<p>Ramps are preferred over transfer systems since not all children who use wheelchairs or other mobility devices may be able to use, or may choose not to use, transfer systems.</p>
<p>Where ramps connect elevated play components, the maximum rise of any ramp run is limited to 12 inches (305 mm).
