<p>This document contains scoping and technical requirements for accessibility to sites, facilities, buildings, and elements by individuals with disabilities.&nbsp; The requirements are to be applied during the design, construction, <cite title="An expansion, extension, or increase in the gross floor area or height of a building or facility.">addition</cite> to, <cite title="A change to a building or facility that affects or could affect the usability of the building or facility or portion thereof.&nbsp; Alteration include, but are not limited to, remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, historic restoration, resurfacing of circulation paths or vehicular ways, changes or rearrangement of the structural parts or elements, and changes or rearrangement in the plan configuration of walls and full-height partitions.&nbsp; Normal maintenance, reroofing, painting or wallpapering, or changes to mechanical and electrical systems are not alterations unless they affect the usability of the building or facility.">alteration</cite>, and lease of sites, facilities, buildings, and elements to the extent required by regulations issued by Federal agencies under the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA).</p>
<h3 id="f102"><a name="F102 Dimensions for Adults and Children"></a>F102 Dimensions for Adults and Children</h3>
<p>The technical requirements are based on adult dimensions and anthropometrics. In addition, this document includes technical requirements based on children's dimensions and anthropometrics for drinking fountains, water closets, toilet compartments, lavatories and sinks, dining surfaces, and work surfaces.</p>
<h3 id="f103"><a name="F103 Modifications and Waivers"></a>F103 Modifications and Waivers</h3>
<p>The Architectural Barriers Act authorizes the Administrator of the General Services Administration, the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of the Department of Defense, and the United States Postal Service to modify or waive the accessibility standards for buildings and facilities covered by the Architectural Barriers Act on a case-by-case basis, upon application made by the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States concerned.&nbsp; The General Services Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Defense, and the United States Postal Service may grant a modification or waiver only upon a determination that it is clearly necessary.&nbsp; Section 502(b)(1) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 authorizes the Access Board to ensure that modifications and waivers are based on findings of fact and are not inconsistent with the Architectural Barriers Act.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory F103 Modifications and Waivers.&nbsp; The provisions for modifications and waivers differ from the requirement issued under the Americans with Disabilities Act in that "equivalent facilitation" does not apply.&nbsp; There is a formal procedure for Federal agencies to request a waiver or modification of applicable standards under the Architectural Barriers Act.</p>
<h3 id="f104"><a name="F104 Conventions"></a>F104 Conventions</h3>
<p id="f1041">F104.1 Dimensions.&nbsp; Dimensions that are not stated as "maximum" or "minimum" are absolute.</p>
<p id="f10411">F104.1.1 Construction and Manufacturing Tolerances.&nbsp; All dimensions are subject to conventional industry tolerances except where the requirement is stated as a range with specific minimum and maximum end points.</p>
<div class="advisory">
<p class="first">Advisory F104.1.1 Construction and Manufacturing Tolerances.&nbsp; Conventional industry tolerances recognized by this provision include those for field conditions and those that may be a necessary consequence of a particular manufacturing process.&nbsp; Recognized tolerances are not intended to apply to design work.</p>
<p>It is good practice when specifying dimensions to avoid specifying a tolerance where dimensions are absolute.&nbsp; For example, if this document requires "1 inches," avoid specifying "1 inches plus or minus X inches."</p>
<p>Where the requirement states a specified range, such as in Section 609.4 where grab bars must be installed between 33 inches and 36 inches above the floor, the range provides an adequate tolerance and therefore no tolerance outside of the range at either end point is permitted.</p>
<p>Where a requirement is a minimum or a maximum dimension that does not have two specific minimum and maximum end points, tolerances may apply.&nbsp; Where an element is to be installed at the minimum or maximum permitted dimension, such as "15 inches minimum" or "5 pounds maximum", it would not be good practice to specify "5 pounds (plus X pounds) or 15 inches (minus X inches)." Rather, it would be good practice to specify a dimension less than the required maximum (or more than the required minimum) by the amount of the expected field or manufacturing tolerance and not to state any tolerance in conjunction with the specified dimension.</p>
<p class="last">Specifying dimensions in design in the manner described above will better ensure that facilities and elements accomplish the level of accessibility intended by these requirements.&nbsp; It will also more often produce an end result of strict and literal compliance with the stated requirements and eliminate enforcement difficulties and issues that might otherwise arise.&nbsp; Information on specific tolerances may be available from industry or trade organizations, code groups and building officials, and published references.</p>
</div>
<p id="f1042">F104.2 Calculation of Percentages.&nbsp; Where the required number of elements or facilities to be provided is determined by calculations of ratios or percentages and remainders or fractions result, the next greater whole number of such elements or facilities shall be provided.&nbsp; Where the determination of the required size or dimension of an element or facility involves ratios or percentages, rounding down for values less than one half shall be permitted.</p>
