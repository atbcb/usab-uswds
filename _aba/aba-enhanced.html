<h1>Chapter 1: Application and Administration</h1>
<div itemprop="articleBody">
<h2 id="aba-f101">F101 Purpose</h2>
<p>This document contains scoping and technical requirements for accessibility to sites, facilities, buildings, and elements by individuals with disabilities.&nbsp; The requirements are to be applied during the design, construction, addition to, alteration, and lease of sites, facilities, buildings, and elements to the extent required by regulations issued by Federal agencies under the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA).</p>
<h2 id="aba-f102">F102 Dimensions for Adults and Children</h2>
<p>The technical requirements are based on adult dimensions and anthropometrics. In addition, this document includes technical requirements based on children's dimensions and anthropometrics for drinking fountains, water closets, toilet compartments, lavatories and sinks, dining surfaces, and work surfaces.</p>
<h2 id="aba-f103">F103 Modifications and Waivers</h2>
<p>The Architectural Barriers Act authorizes the Administrator of the General Services Administration, the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of the Department of Defense, and the United States Postal Service to modify or waive the accessibility standards for buildings and facilities covered by the Architectural Barriers Act on a case-by-case basis, upon application made by the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States concerned.&nbsp; The General Services Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Defense, and the United States Postal Service may grant a modification or waiver only upon a determination that it is clearly necessary.&nbsp; Section 502(b)(1) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 authorizes the Access Board to ensure that modifications and waivers are based on findings of fact and are not inconsistent with the Architectural Barriers Act.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory F103 Modifications and Waivers.&nbsp; The provisions for modifications and waivers differ from the requirement issued under the Americans with Disabilities Act in that "equivalent facilitation" does not apply.&nbsp; There is a formal procedure for Federal agencies to request a waiver or modification of applicable standards under the Architectural Barriers Act.</p>
<h2 id="aba-f104">F104 Conventions</h2>
<h3 id="aba-f104_1">F104.1 Dimensions</h3>
<p>Dimensions that are not stated as "maximum" or "minimum" are absolute.</p>
<h4 id="aba-f104_1_1">F104.1.1 Construction and Manufacturing Tolerances</h4>
<p>All dimensions are subject to conventional industry tolerances except where the requirement is stated as a range with specific minimum and maximum end points.</p>
<div class="advisory">
<p class="first">Advisory F104.1.1 Construction and Manufacturing Tolerances.&nbsp; Conventional industry tolerances recognized by this provision include those for field conditions and those that may be a necessary consequence of a particular manufacturing process.&nbsp; Recognized tolerances are not intended to apply to design work.</p>
<p>It is good practice when specifying dimensions to avoid specifying a tolerance where dimensions are absolute.&nbsp; For example, if this document requires "1 inches," avoid specifying "1 inches plus or minus X inches."</p>
<p>Where the requirement states a specified range, such as in Section 609.4 where grab bars must be installed between 33 inches and 36 inches above the floor, the range provides an adequate tolerance and therefore no tolerance outside of the range at either end point is permitted.</p>
<p>Where a requirement is a minimum or a maximum dimension that does not have two specific minimum and maximum end points, tolerances may apply.&nbsp; Where an element is to be installed at the minimum or maximum permitted dimension, such as "15 inches minimum" or "5 pounds maximum", it would not be good practice to specify "5 pounds (plus X pounds) or 15 inches (minus X inches)." Rather, it would be good practice to specify a dimension less than the required maximum (or more than the required minimum) by the amount of the expected field or manufacturing tolerance and not to state any tolerance in conjunction with the specified dimension.</p>
<p class="last">Specifying dimensions in design in the manner described above will better ensure that facilities and elements accomplish the level of accessibility intended by these requirements.&nbsp; It will also more often produce an end result of strict and literal compliance with the stated requirements and eliminate enforcement difficulties and issues that might otherwise arise.&nbsp; Information on specific tolerances may be available from industry or trade organizations, code groups and building officials, and published references.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="aba-f104_2">F104.2 Calculation of Percentages</h3>
<p>Where the required number of elements or facilities to be provided is determined by calculations of ratios or percentages and remainders or fractions result, the next greater whole number of such elements or facilities shall be provided.&nbsp; Where the determination of the required size or dimension of an element or facility involves ratios or percentages, rounding down for values less than one half shall be permitted.</p>
<h3 id="aba-f104_3">F104.3 Figures</h3>
<p>Unless specifically stated otherwise, figures are provided for informational purposes only.</p>

<p>ASME A17.1- 2000 Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators, including ASME A17.1a-2002 Addenda and ASME A17.1b-2003 Addenda (see 407.1, 408.1, 409.1, and 810.9).</p>
<p>ASME A18.1-1999 Safety Standard for Platform Lifts and Stairway Chairlifts, including ASME A18.1a-2001 Addenda and ASME A18.1b-2001 Addenda (see 410.1).</p>
<p>ASME A18.1-2003 Safety Standard for Platform Lifts and Stairway Chairlifts, (see 410.1).</p>
<div class="advisory">
<p class="first">Advisory F105.2.2 ASME.&nbsp; ASME A17.1-2000 is used by local jurisdictions throughout the United States for the design, construction, installation, operation, inspection, testing, maintenance, alteration, and repair of elevators and escalators.&nbsp; The majority of the requirements apply to the operational machinery not seen or used by elevator passengers.&nbsp; ASME A17.1 requires a two-way means of emergency communications in passenger elevators.&nbsp; This means of communication must connect with emergency or authorized personnel and not an automated answering system.&nbsp; The communication system must be push button activated.&nbsp; The activation button must be permanently identified with the word "HELP." A visual indication acknowledging the establishment of a communications link to authorized personnel must be provided.&nbsp; The visual indication must remain on until the call is terminated by authorized personnel.&nbsp; The building location, the elevator car number, and the need for assistance must be provided to authorized personnel answering the emergency call.&nbsp; The use of a handset by the communications system is prohibited.&nbsp; Only the authorized personnel answering the call can terminate the call.&nbsp; Operating instructions for the communications system must be provided in the elevator car.</p>
<p>The provisions for escalators require that at least two flat steps be provided at the entrance and exit of every escalator and that steps on escalators be demarcated by yellow lines 2 inches wide maximum along the back and sides of steps.</p>
<p>ASME A18.1-1999 and ASME A18.1-2003 address the design, construction, installation, operation, inspection, testing, maintenance and repair of lifts that are intended for transportation of persons with disabilities.&nbsp; Lifts are classified as: vertical platform lifts, inclined platform lifts, inclined stairway chairlifts, private residence vertical platform lifts, private residence inclined platform lifts, and private residence inclined stairway chairlifts.</p>
<p>This document does not permit the use of inclined stairway chairlifts which do not provide platforms because such lifts require the user to transfer to a seat.</p>
<p>ASME A18.1 contains requirements for runways, which are the spaces in which platforms or seats move.&nbsp; The standard includes additional provisions for runway enclosures, electrical equipment and wiring, structural support, headroom clearance (which is 80 inches minimum), lower level access ramps and pits.&nbsp; The enclosure walls not used for entry or exit are required to have a grab bar the full length of the wall on platform lifts.&nbsp; Access ramps are required to meet requirements similar to those for ramps in Chapter 4 of this document.</p>
<p class="last">Each of the lift types addressed in ASME A18.1 must meet requirements for capacity, load, speed, travel, operating devices, and control equipment.&nbsp; The maximum permitted height for operable parts is consistent with Section 308 of this document.&nbsp; The standard also addresses attendant operation.&nbsp; However, Section 410.1 of this document does not permit attendant operation.</p>

<p>ASTM F 1951-99 Standard Specification for Determination of Accessibility of Surface Systems Under and Around Playground Equipment (see 1008.2.6.1).</p>
<div class="advisory">
<p class="first">Advisory F105.2.3 ASTM.&nbsp; ASTM F 1292-99 and ASTM F 1292-04 establish a uniform means to measure and compare characteristics of surfacing materials to determine whether materials provide a safe surface under and around playground equipment.&nbsp; These standards are referenced in the play areas requirements of this document when an accessible surface is required inside a play area use zone where a fall attenuating surface is also required.&nbsp; The standards cover the minimum impact attenuation requirements, when tested in accordance with Test Method F 355, for surface systems to be used under and around any piece of playground equipment from which a person may fall.</p>
<p>ASTM F 1487-01 establishes a nationally recognized safety standard for public playground equipment to address injuries identified by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.&nbsp; It defines the use zone, which is the ground area beneath and immediately adjacent to a play structure or play equipment designed for unrestricted circulation around the equipment and on whose surface it is predicted that a user would land when falling from or exiting a play structure or equipment.&nbsp; The play areas requirements in this document reference the ASTM F 1487 standard when defining accessible routes that overlap use zones requiring fall attenuating surfaces.&nbsp; If the use zone of a playground is not entirely surfaced with an accessible material, at least one accessible route within the use zone must be provided from the perimeter to all accessible play structures or components within the playground.</p>
<p class="last">ASTM F 1951-99 establishes a uniform means to measure the characteristics of surface systems in order to provide performance specifications to select materials for use as an accessible surface under and around playground equipment.&nbsp; Surface materials that comply with this standard and are located in the use zone must also comply with ASTM F 1292.&nbsp; The test methods in this standard address access for children and adults who may traverse the surfacing to aid children who are playing.&nbsp; When a surface is tested it must have an average work per foot value for straight propulsion and for turning less than the average work per foot values for straight propulsion and for turning, respectively, on a hard, smooth surface with a grade of 7% (1:14).</p>

<p class="advisory">Advisory F221.2.1.2 Luxury Boxes, Club Boxes, and Suites in Arenas, Stadiums, and Grandstands.&nbsp; The number of wheelchair spaces required in luxury boxes, club boxes, and suites within an arena, stadium, or grandstand is to be calculated box by box and suite by suite.</p>
<h5 id="aba-f221_2_1_3">F221.2.1.3 Other Boxes</h5>
<p>In boxes other than those required to comply with F221.2.1.2, the total number of wheelchair spaces required shall be determined in accordance with Table F221.2.1.1.&nbsp; Wheelchair spaces shall be located in not less than 20 percent of all boxes provided.&nbsp; Wheelchair spaces shall comply with 802.1.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory F221.2.1.3 Other Boxes.&nbsp; The provision for seating in "other boxes" includes box seating provided in facilities such as performing arts auditoria where tiered boxes are designed for spatial and acoustical purposes. The number of wheelchair spaces required in boxes covered by 221.2.1.3 is calculated based on the total number of seats provided in these other boxes.&nbsp; The resulting number of wheelchair spaces must be located in no fewer than 20% of the boxes covered by this section.&nbsp; For example, a concert hall has 20 boxes, each of which contains 10 seats, totaling 200 seats.&nbsp; In this example, 5 wheelchair spaces would be required, and they must be placed in at least 4 of the boxes. Additionally, because the wheelchair spaces must also meet the dispersion requirements of 221.2.3, the boxes containing these wheelchair spaces cannot all be located in one area unless an exception to the dispersion requirements applies.</p>

<p>Wheelchair spaces shall be an integral part of the seating plan.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory F221.2.2 Integration.&nbsp; The requirement that wheelchair spaces be an "integral part of the seating plan" means that wheelchair spaces must be placed within the footprint of the seating area.&nbsp; Wheelchair spaces cannot be segregated from seating areas.&nbsp; For example, it would be unacceptable to place only the wheelchair spaces, or only the wheelchair spaces and their associated companion seats, outside the seating areas defined by risers in an assembly area.</p>
<h4 id="aba-f221_2_3">F221.2.3 Lines of Sight and Dispersion</h4>
<p>Wheelchair spaces shall provide lines of sight complying with 802.2 and shall comply with F221.2.3.&nbsp; In providing lines of sight, wheelchair spaces shall be dispersed.&nbsp; Wheelchair spaces shall provide spectators with choices of seating locations and viewing angles that are substantially equivalent to, or better than, the choices of seating locations and viewing angles available to all other spectators.&nbsp; When the number of wheelchair spaces required by F221.2.1 has been met, further dispersion shall not be required.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; In row seating, two wheelchair spaces shall be permitted to be located side-by-side.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory F221.2.3.1 Horizontal Dispersion.&nbsp; Horizontal dispersion of wheelchair spaces is the placement of spaces in an assembly facility seating area from side-to-side or, in the case of an arena or stadium, around the field of play or performance area.</p>
<h5 id="aba-f221_2_3_2">F221.2.3.2 Vertical Dispersion</h5>
<p>Wheelchair spaces shall be dispersed vertically at varying distances from the screen, performance area, or playing field.&nbsp; In addition, wheelchair spaces shall be located in each balcony or mezzanine that is located on an accessible route.</p>
<p>EXCEPTIONS:&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Vertical dispersion shall not be required in assembly areas with 300 or fewer seats if the wheelchair spaces provide viewing angles that are equivalent to, or better than, the average viewing angle provided in the facility.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; In bleachers, wheelchair spaces shall not be required to be provided in rows other than rows at points of entry to bleacher seating.</p>
<div class="advisory">
<p class="first">Advisory F221.2.3.2 Vertical Dispersion.&nbsp; When wheelchair spaces are dispersed vertically in an assembly facility they are placed at different locations within the seating area from front-to-back so that the distance from the screen, stage, playing field, area of sports activity, or other focal point is varied among wheelchair spaces.</p>
<p class="last">Advisory F221.2.3.2 Vertical Dispersion Exception 2.&nbsp; Points of entry to bleacher seating may include, but are not limited to, cross aisles, concourses, vomitories, and entrance ramps and stairs.&nbsp; Vertical, center, or side aisles adjoining bleacher seating that are stepped or tiered are not considered entry points.</p>

<p>EXCEPTION:&nbsp; Team or player seating areas serving areas of sport activity shall not be required to comply with F221.4.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory F221.4 Designated Aisle Seats.&nbsp; When selecting which aisle seats will meet the requirements of 802.4, those aisle seats which are closest to, not necessarily on, accessible routes must be selected first.&nbsp; For example, an assembly area has two aisles (A and B) serving seating areas with an accessible route connecting to the top and bottom of Aisle A only.&nbsp; The aisle seats chosen to meet 802.4 must be those at the top and bottom of Aisle A, working toward the middle.&nbsp; Only when all seats on Aisle A would not meet the five percent minimum would seats on Aisle B be designated.</p>

<h3 id="aba-f222_1">F222.1 General</h3>
<p>Where dressing rooms, fitting rooms, or locker rooms are provided, at least 5 percent, but no fewer than one, of each type of use in each cluster provided shall comply with 803.</p>
<p>EXCEPTION:&nbsp; In alterations, where it is technically infeasible to provide rooms in accordance with F222.1, one room for each sex on each level shall comply with 803. Where only unisex rooms are provided, unisex rooms shall be permitted.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory F222.1 General.&nbsp; A "cluster" is a group of rooms proximate to one another.&nbsp; Generally, rooms in a cluster are within sight of, or adjacent to, one another.&nbsp; Different styles of design provide users varying levels of privacy and convenience.&nbsp; Some designs include private changing facilities that are close to core areas of the facility, while other designs use space more economically and provide only group dressing facilities.&nbsp; Regardless of the type of facility, dressing, fitting, and locker rooms should provide people with disabilities rooms that are equally private and convenient to those provided others.&nbsp; For example, in a physician's office, if people without disabilities must traverse the full length of the office suite in clothing other than their street clothes, it is acceptable for people with disabilities to be asked to do the same.</p>
<h3 id="aba-f222_2">F222.2 Coat Hooks and Shelves</h3>
<p>Where coat hooks or shelves are provided in dressing, fitting or locker rooms without individual compartments, at least one of each type shall comply with 803.5.&nbsp; Where coat hooks or shelves are provided in individual compartments at least one of each type complying with 803.5 shall be provided in individual compartments in dressing, fitting, or locker rooms required to comply with F222.1.</p>

<p>In licensed medical care facilities and licensed long-term care facilities where the period of stay exceeds twenty-four hours, patient or resident sleeping rooms shall be provided in accordance with F223.</p>
<p>EXCEPTION:&nbsp; Toilet rooms that are part of critical or intensive care patient sleeping rooms shall not be required to comply with 603.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory F223.1 General.&nbsp; Because medical facilities frequently reconfigure spaces to reflect changes in medical specialties, Section F223.1 does not include a provision for dispersion of accessible patient or resident sleeping rooms.&nbsp; The lack of a design requirement does not mean that covered entities are not required to provide services to people with disabilities where accessible rooms are not dispersed in specialty areas.&nbsp; Locate accessible rooms near core areas that are less likely to change over time.&nbsp; While dispersion is not required, the flexibility it provides can be a critical factor in ensuring cost effective compliance with applicable civil rights laws, including Sections 501 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.&nbsp; Additionally, all types of features and amenities should be dispersed among accessible sleeping rooms to ensure equal access to and a variety of choices for all patients and residents.</p>
<h4 id="aba-f223_1_1">F223.1.1 Alterations</h4>
<p>Where sleeping rooms are altered or added, the requirements of F223 shall apply only to the sleeping rooms being altered or added until the number of sleeping rooms complies with the minimum number required for new construction.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory F223.1.1 Alterations.&nbsp; In alterations and additions, the minimum required number is based on the total number of sleeping rooms altered or added instead of on the total number of sleeping rooms provided in a facility.&nbsp; As a facility is altered over time, every effort should be made to disperse accessible sleeping rooms among patient care areas such as pediatrics, cardiac care, maternity, and other units.&nbsp; In this way, people with disabilities can have access to the full-range of services provided by a medical care facility.</p>

<p>In facilities specializing in treating conditions that affect mobility, 100 percent of the patient sleeping rooms shall provide mobility features complying with 805.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory F223.2.2 Facilities Specializing in Treating Conditions That Affect Mobility.&nbsp; Conditions that affect mobility include conditions requiring the use or assistance of a brace, cane, crutch, prosthetic device, wheelchair, or powered mobility aid; arthritic, neurological, or orthopedic conditions that severely limit one's ability to walk; respiratory diseases and other conditions which may require the use of portable oxygen; and cardiac conditions that impose significant functional limitations.&nbsp; Facilities that may provide treatment for, but that do not specialize in treatment of such conditions, such as general rehabilitation hospitals, are not subject to this requirement but are subject to Section F223.2.1.</p>

<p class="advisory">Advisory F224.1 General.&nbsp; Certain facilities used for transient lodging including time shares, dormitories, and town homes may be covered by both these requirements and the Fair Housing Amendments Act.&nbsp; The Fair Housing Amendments Act requires that certain residential structures having four or more multi-family dwelling units, regardless of whether they are privately owned or federally assisted, include certain features of accessible and adaptable design according to guidelines established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).&nbsp; This law and the appropriate regulations should be consulted before proceeding with the design and construction of residential housing.</p>
<h4 id="aba-f224_1_1">F224.1.1 Alterations</h4>
<p>Alterations include, but are not limited to, remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, historic restoration, resurfacing of circulation paths or vehicular ways, changes or rearrangement of the structural parts or elements, and changes or rearrangement in the plan configuration of walls and full-height partitions.&nbsp; Normal maintenance, reroofing, painting or wallpapering, or changes to mechanical and electrical systems are not alterations unless they affect the usability of the building or facility.">Alterations</cite>.&nbsp; Where guest rooms are altered or added, the requirements of F224 shall apply only to the guest rooms being altered or added until the number of guest rooms complies with the minimum number required for new construction.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory F224.1.1 Alterations.&nbsp; In alterations and additions, the minimum required number of accessible guest rooms is based on the total number of guest rooms altered or added instead of the total number of guest rooms provided in a facility.&nbsp; Typically, each alteration of a facility is limited to a particular portion of the facility.&nbsp; When accessible guest rooms are added as a result of subsequent alterations, compliance with 224.5 (Dispersion) is more likely to be achieved if all of the accessible guest rooms are not provided in the same area of the facility.</p>
<h4 id="aba-f224_1_2">F224.1.2 Guest Room Doors and Doorways</h4>
<p>Entrances, doors, and doorways providing user passage into and within guest rooms that are not required to provide mobility features complying with 806.2 shall comply with 404.2.3.</p>
<p>EXCEPTION:&nbsp; Shower and sauna doors in guest rooms that are not required to provide mobility features complying with 806.2 shall not be required to comply with 404.2.3.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory F224.1.2 Guest Room Doors and Doorways.&nbsp; Because of the social interaction that often occurs in lodging facilities, an accessible clear opening width is required for doors and doorways to and within all guest rooms, including those not required to be accessible.&nbsp; This applies to all doors, including bathroom doors, that allow full user passage.&nbsp; Other requirements for doors and doorways in Section 404 do not apply to guest rooms not required to provide mobility features.</p>

<p>Play areas for children ages 2 and over shall comply with F240.&nbsp; Where separate play areas are provided within a site for specific age groups, each play area shall comply with F240.</p>
<p>EXCEPTIONS:&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Play areas located in family child care facilities where the proprietor actually resides shall not be required to comply with F240.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; In existing play areas, where play components are relocated for the purposes of creating safe use zones and the ground surface is not altered or extended for more than one use zone, the play area shall not be required to comply with F240.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Amusement attractions shall not be required to comply with F240.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Where play components are altered and the ground surface is not altered, the ground surface shall not be required to comply with 1008.2.6 unless required by F202.4.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory F240.1 General.&nbsp; Play areas may be located on exterior sites or within a building.&nbsp; Where separate play areas are provided within a site for children in specified age groups (e.g., preschool (ages 2 to 5) and school age (ages 5 to 12)), each play area must comply with this section.&nbsp; Where play areas are provided for the same age group on a site but are geographically separated (e.g., one is located next to a picnic area and another is located next to a softball field), they are considered separate play areas and each play area must comply with this section.</p>
<h4 id="aba-f240_1_1">F240.1.1 Additions</h4>
<p>Where play areas are designed and constructed in phases, the requirements of F240 shall apply to each successive addition so that when the addition is completed, the entire play area complies with all the applicable requirements of F240.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory F240.1.1 Additions.&nbsp; These requirements are to be applied so that when each successive addition is completed, the entire play area complies with all applicable provisions.&nbsp; For example, a play area is built in two phases.&nbsp; In the first phase, there are 10 elevated play components and 10 elevated play components are added in the second phase for a total of 20 elevated play components in the play area.&nbsp; When the first phase was completed, at least 5 elevated play components, including at least 3 different types, were to be provided on an accessible route.&nbsp; When the second phase is completed, at least 10 elevated play components must be located on an accessible route, and at least 7 ground level play components, including 4 different types, must be provided on an accessible route.&nbsp; At the time the second phase is complete, ramps must be used to connect at least 5 of the elevated play components and transfer systems are permitted to be used to connect the rest of the elevated play components required to be located on an accessible route.</p>
<h3 id="aba-f240_2">F240.2 Play Components</h3>
<p>Where provided, play components shall comply with F240.2.</p>
<h4 id="aba-f240_2_1">F240.2.1 Ground Level Play Components</h4>
<p>Ground level play components shall be provided in the number and types required by F240.2.1.&nbsp; Ground level play components that are provided to comply with F240.2.1.1 shall be permitted to satisfy the additional number required by F240.2.1.2 if the minimum required types of play components are satisfied.&nbsp; Where two or more required ground level play components are provided, they shall be dispersed throughout the play area and integrated with other play components.</p>
<div class="advisory">
<p class="first">Advisory F240.2.1 Ground Level Play Components.&nbsp; Examples of ground level play components may include spring rockers, swings, diggers, and stand-alone slides.&nbsp; When distinguishing between the different types of ground level play components, consider the general experience provided by the play component.&nbsp; Examples of different types of experiences include, but are not limited to, rocking, swinging, climbing, spinning, and sliding.&nbsp; A spiral slide may provide a slightly different experience from a straight slide, but sliding is the general experience and therefore a spiral slide is not considered a different type of play component from a straight slide.</p>
<p>Ground level play components accessed by children with disabilities must be integrated into the play area.&nbsp; Designers should consider the optimal layout of ground level play components accessed by children with disabilities to foster interaction and socialization among all children. Grouping all ground level play components accessed by children with disabilities in one location is not considered integrated.</p>
<p>Where a stand-alone slide is provided, an accessible route must connect the base of the stairs at the entry point to the exit point of the slide.&nbsp; A ramp or transfer system to the top of the slide is not required.&nbsp; Where a sand box is provided, an accessible route must connect to the border of the sand box.&nbsp; Accessibility to the sand box would be enhanced by providing a transfer system into the sand or by providing a raised sand table with knee clearance complying with 1008.4.3.</p>
<p>Ramps are preferred over transfer systems since not all children who use wheelchairs or other mobility devices may be able to use, or may choose not to use, transfer systems.</p>
<p>Where ramps connect elevated play components, the maximum rise of any ramp run is limited to 12 inches (305 mm). Where possible, designers and operators are encouraged to provide ramps with a slope less than the 1:12 maximum. Berms or sculpted dirt may be used to provide elevation and may be part of an accessible route to composite play structures.</p>
<p class="last">Platform lifts are permitted as a part of an accessible route.&nbsp; Because lifts must be independently operable, operators should carefully consider the appropriateness of their use in unsupervised settings.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="aba-f240_2_1_1">F240.2.1.1 Minimum Number and Types</h5>
<p>Where ground level play components are provided, at least one of each type shall be on an accessible route and shall comply with 1008.4.</p>
<h5 id="aba-f240_2_1_2">F240.2.1.2 Additional Number and Types</h5>
<p>Where elevated play components are provided, ground level play components shall be provided in accordance with Table F240.2.1.2 and shall comply with 1008.4.</p>
<p>EXCEPTION:&nbsp; If at least 50 percent of the elevated play components are connected by a ramp and at least 3 of the elevated play components connected by the ramp are different types of play components, the play area shall not be required to comply with F240.2.1.2.</p>

<div class="advisory">
<p class="first">Advisory F240.2.2 Elevated Play Components.&nbsp; A double or triple slide that is part of a composite play structure is one elevated play component. For purposes of this section, ramps, transfer systems, steps, decks, and roofs are not considered elevated play components.&nbsp; Although socialization and pretend play can occur on these elements, they are not primarily intended for play.</p>
<p class="last">Some play components that are attached to a composite play structure can be approached or exited at the ground level or above grade from a platform or deck.&nbsp; For example, a climber attached to a composite play structure can be approached or exited at the ground level or above grade from a platform or deck on a composite play structure.&nbsp; Play components that are attached to a composite play structure and can be approached from a platform or deck (e.g., climbers and overhead play components) are considered elevated play components.&nbsp; These play components are not considered ground level play components and do not count toward the requirements in F240.2.1.2 regarding the number of ground level play components that must be located on an accessible route.</p>

<p>Assistive listening systems required in assembly areas shall comply with 706.</p>
  <div class="advisory">
  <p class="first">Advisory 706.1 General.&nbsp; Assistive listening systems are generally categorized by their mode of transmission.&nbsp; There are hard-wired systems and three types of wireless systems: induction loop, infrared, and FM radio transmission.&nbsp; Each has different advantages and disadvantages that can help determine which system is best for a given application.&nbsp; For example, an FM system may be better than an infrared system in some open-air assemblies since infrared signals are less effective in sunlight.&nbsp; On the other hand, an infrared system is typically a better choice than an FM system where confidential transmission is important because it will be contained within a given space.</p>
  <p>The technical standards for assistive listening systems describe minimum performance levels for volume, interference, and distortion.&nbsp; Sound pressure levels (SPL), expressed in decibels, measure output sound volume.&nbsp; Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR or S/N), also expressed in decibels, represents the relationship between the loudness of a desired sound (the signal) and the background noise in a space or piece of equipment.&nbsp; The higher the SNR, the more intelligible the signal.&nbsp; The peak clipping level limits the distortion in signal output produced when high-volume sound waves are manipulated to serve assistive listening devices.</p>
  <p class="last">Selecting or specifying an effective assistive listening system for a large or complex venue requires assistance from a professional sound engineer.&nbsp; The Access Board has published technical assistance on assistive listening devices and systems.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp; In existing piers, clear pier space shall be permitted to be located perpendicular to the boat slip and shall extend the width of the boat slip, where the facility has at least one boat slip complying with 1003.3, and further compliance with 1003.3 would result in a reduction in the number of boat slips available or result in a reduction of the widths of existing slips.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory 1003.3.1 Boat Slip Clearance Exception 3. Where the conditions in exception 3 are satisfied, existing facilities are only required to have one accessible boat slip with a pier clearance which runs the length of the slip. All other accessible slips are allowed to have the required pier clearance at the head of the slip. Under this exception, at piers with perpendicular boat slips, the width of most "finger piers" will remain unchanged. However, where mooring systems for floating piers are replaced as part of pier alteration projects, an opportunity may exist for increasing accessibility</cite>. Piers may be reconfigured to allow an increase in the number of wider finger piers, and serve as accessible boat slips.</p>
