<h1>Chapter 1: Application and Administration</h1>
<div itemprop="articleBody">
<h2 id="aba-f101">F101 Purpose</h2>
<p>This document contains scoping and technical requirements for accessibility to sites, facilities, buildings, and elements by individuals with disabilities.&nbsp; The requirements are to be applied during the design, construction, addition to, alteration, and lease of sites, facilities, buildings, and elements to the extent required by regulations issued by Federal agencies under the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA).</p>
<h2 id="aba-f102">F102 Dimensions for Adults and Children</h2>
<p>The technical requirements are based on adult dimensions and anthropometrics. In addition, this document includes technical requirements based on children's dimensions and anthropometrics for drinking fountains, water closets, toilet compartments, lavatories and sinks, dining surfaces, and work surfaces.</p>
<h2 id="aba-f103">F103 Modifications and Waivers</h2>
<p>The Architectural Barriers Act authorizes the Administrator of the General Services Administration, the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of the Department of Defense, and the United States Postal Service to modify or waive the accessibility standards for buildings and facilities covered by the Architectural Barriers Act on a case-by-case basis, upon application made by the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States concerned.&nbsp; The General Services Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Defense, and the United States Postal Service may grant a modification or waiver only upon a determination that it is clearly necessary.&nbsp; Section <a href="#aba-502" class="navSectionLink">502</a>(b)(1) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 authorizes the Access Board to ensure that modifications and waivers are based on findings of fact and are not inconsistent with the Architectural Barriers Act.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory F103 Modifications and Waivers.&nbsp; The provisions for modifications and waivers differ from the requirement issued under the Americans with Disabilities Act in that "equivalent facilitation" does not apply.&nbsp; There is a formal procedure for Federal agencies to request a waiver or modification of applicable standards under the Architectural Barriers Act.</p>
<h2 id="aba-f104">F104 Conventions</h2>
<h3 id="aba-f104_1">F104.1 Dimensions</h3>
<p>Dimensions that are not stated as "maximum" or "minimum" are absolute.</p>
<h4 id="aba-f104_1_1">F104.1.1 Construction and Manufacturing Tolerances</h4>
<p>All dimensions are subject to conventional industry tolerances except where the requirement is stated as a range with specific minimum and maximum end points.</p>
<div class="advisory">
<p class="first">Advisory F104.1.1 Construction and Manufacturing Tolerances.&nbsp; Conventional industry tolerances recognized by this provision include those for field conditions and those that may be a necessary consequence of a particular manufacturing process.&nbsp; Recognized tolerances are not intended to apply to design work.</p>
<p>It is good practice when specifying dimensions to avoid specifying a tolerance where dimensions are absolute.&nbsp; For example, if this document requires "1 inches," avoid specifying "1 inches plus or minus X inches."</p>
<p>Where the requirement states a specified range, such as in Section <a href="#aba-609_4" class="navSectionLink">609.4</a> where grab bars must be installed between 33 inches and 36 inches above the floor, the range provides an adequate tolerance and therefore no tolerance outside of the range at either end point is permitted.</p>
<p>Where a requirement is a minimum or a maximum dimension that does not have two specific minimum and maximum end points, tolerances may apply.&nbsp; Where an element is to be installed at the minimum or maximum permitted dimension, such as "15 inches minimum" or "5 pounds maximum", it would not be good practice to specify "5 pounds (plus X pounds) or 15 inches (minus X inches)." Rather, it would be good practice to specify a dimension less than the required maximum (or more than the required minimum) by the amount of the expected field or manufacturing tolerance and not to state any tolerance in conjunction with the specified dimension.</p>
<p class="last">Specifying dimensions in design in the manner described above will better ensure that facilities and elements accomplish the level of accessibility intended by these requirements.&nbsp; It will also more often produce an end result of strict and literal compliance with the stated requirements and eliminate enforcement difficulties and issues that might otherwise arise.&nbsp; Information on specific tolerances may be available from industry or trade organizations, code groups and building officials, and published references.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="aba-f104_2">F104.2 Calculation of Percentages</h3>
<p>Where the required number of elements or facilities to be provided is determined by calculations of ratios or percentages and remainders or fractions result, the next greater whole number of such elements or facilities shall be provided.&nbsp; Where the determination of the required size or dimension of an element or facility involves ratios or percentages, rounding down for values less than one half shall be permitted.</p>
<h3 id="aba-f104_3">F104.3 Figures</h3>
<p>Unless specifically stated otherwise, figures are provided for informational purposes only.</p>

<p>ASME A17.1- 2000 Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators, including ASME A17.1a-2002 Addenda and ASME A17.1b-2003 Addenda (see <a href="#aba-407_1" class="navSectionLink">407.1</a>, <a href="#aba-408_1" class="navSectionLink">408.1</a>, <a href="#aba-409_1" class="navSectionLink">409.1</a>, and <a href="#aba-810_9" class="navSectionLink">810.9</a>).</p>
<p>ASME A18.1-1999 Safety Standard for Platform Lifts and Stairway Chairlifts, including ASME A18.1a-2001 Addenda and ASME A18.1b-2001 Addenda (see <a href="#aba-410_1" class="navSectionLink">410.1</a>).</p>
<p>ASME A18.1-2003 Safety Standard for Platform Lifts and Stairway Chairlifts, (see <a href="#aba-410_1" class="navSectionLink">410.1</a>).</p>
<div class="advisory">
<p class="first">Advisory F105.2.2 ASME.&nbsp; ASME A17.1-2000 is used by local jurisdictions throughout the United States for the design, construction, installation, operation, inspection, testing, maintenance, alteration, and repair of elevators and escalators.&nbsp; The majority of the requirements apply to the operational machinery not seen or used by elevator passengers.&nbsp; ASME A17.1 requires a two-way means of emergency communications in passenger elevators.&nbsp; This means of communication must connect with emergency or authorized personnel and not an automated answering system.&nbsp; The communication system must be push button activated.&nbsp; The activation button must be permanently identified with the word "HELP." A visual indication acknowledging the establishment of a communications link to authorized personnel must be provided.&nbsp; The visual indication must remain on until the call is terminated by authorized personnel.&nbsp; The building location, the elevator car number, and the need for assistance must be provided to authorized personnel answering the emergency call.&nbsp; The use of a handset by the communications system is prohibited.&nbsp; Only the authorized personnel answering the call can terminate the call.&nbsp; Operating instructions for the communications system must be provided in the elevator car.</p>
<p>The provisions for escalators require that at least two flat steps be provided at the entrance and exit of every escalator and that steps on escalators be demarcated by yellow lines 2 inches wide maximum along the back and sides of steps.</p>
<p>ASME A18.1-1999 and ASME A18.1-2003 address the design, construction, installation, operation, inspection, testing, maintenance and repair of lifts that are intended for transportation of persons with disabilities.&nbsp; Lifts are classified as: vertical platform lifts, inclined platform lifts, inclined stairway chairlifts, private residence vertical platform lifts, private residence inclined platform lifts, and private residence inclined stairway chairlifts.</p>
<p>This document does not permit the use of inclined stairway chairlifts which do not provide platforms because such lifts require the user to transfer to a seat.</p>
<p>ASME A18.1 contains requirements for runways, which are the spaces in which platforms or seats move.&nbsp; The standard includes additional provisions for runway enclosures, electrical equipment and wiring, structural support, headroom clearance (which is 80 inches minimum), lower level access ramps and pits.&nbsp; The enclosure walls not used for entry or exit are required to have a grab bar the full length of the wall on platform lifts.&nbsp; Access ramps are required to meet requirements similar to those for ramps in Chapter 4 of this document.</p>
<p class="last">Each of the lift types addressed in ASME A18.1 must meet requirements for capacity, load, speed, travel, operating devices, and control equipment.&nbsp; The maximum permitted height for operable parts is consistent with Section <a href="#aba-308" class="navSectionLink">308</a> of this document.&nbsp; The standard also addresses attendant operation.&nbsp; However, Section <a href="#aba-410_1" class="navSectionLink">410.1</a> of this document does not permit attendant operation.</p>

<div class="advisory">
<p class="first">Advisory F105.2.3 ASTM.&nbsp; ASTM F 1292-99 and ASTM F 1292-04 establish a uniform means to measure and compare characteristics of surfacing materials to determine whether materials provide a safe surface under and around playground equipment.&nbsp; These standards are referenced in the play areas requirements of this document when an accessible surface is required inside a play area use zone where a fall attenuating surface is also required.&nbsp; The standards cover the minimum impact attenuation requirements, when tested in accordance with Test Method F 355, for surface systems to be used under and around any piece of playground equipment from which a person may fall.</p>
<p>ASTM F 1487-01 establishes a nationally recognized safety standard for public playground equipment to address injuries identified by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.&nbsp; It defines the use zone, which is the ground area beneath and immediately adjacent to a play structure or play equipment designed for unrestricted circulation around the equipment and on whose surface it is predicted that a user would land when falling from or exiting a play structure or equipment.&nbsp; The play areas requirements in this document reference the ASTM F 1487 standard when defining accessible routes that overlap use zones requiring fall attenuating surfaces.&nbsp; If the use zone of a playground is not entirely surfaced with an accessible material, at least one accessible route within the use zone must be provided from the perimeter to all accessible play structures or components within the playground.</p>
<p class="last">ASTM F 1951-99 establishes a uniform means to measure the characteristics of surface systems in order to provide performance specifications to select materials for use as an accessible surface under and around playground equipment.&nbsp; Surface materials that comply with this standard and are located in the use zone must also comply with ASTM F 1292.&nbsp; The test methods in this standard address access for children and adults who may traverse the surfacing to aid children who are playing.&nbsp; When a surface is tested it must have an average work per foot value for straight propulsion and for turning less than the average work per foot values for straight propulsion and for turning, respectively, on a hard, smooth surface with a grade of 7% (1:14).</p>

Where only unisex rooms are provided, unisex rooms shall be permitted.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory F222.1 General.&nbsp; A "cluster" is a group of rooms proximate to one another.&nbsp; Generally, rooms in a cluster are within sight of, or adjacent to, one another.&nbsp; Different styles of design provide users varying levels of privacy and convenience.&nbsp; Some designs include private changing facilities that are close to core areas of the facility, while other designs use space more economically and provide only group dressing facilities.&nbsp; Regardless of the type of facility, dressing, fitting, and locker rooms should provide people with disabilities rooms that are equally private and convenient to those provided others.&nbsp; For example, in a physician's office, if people without disabilities must traverse the full length of the office suite in clothing other than their street clothes, it is acceptable for people with disabilities to be asked to do the same.</p>

<p class="advisory">Advisory F224.1.1 Alterations.&nbsp; In alterations and additions, the minimum required number of accessible guest rooms is based on the total number of guest rooms altered or added instead of the total number of guest rooms provided in a facility.&nbsp; Typically, each alteration of a facility is limited to a particular portion of the facility.&nbsp; When accessible guest rooms are added as a result of subsequent alterations, compliance with <a href="#aba-224_5" class="navSectionLink">224.5</a> (Dispersion) is more likely to be achieved if all of the accessible guest rooms are not provided in the same area of the facility.</p>

<p class="advisory">Advisory F240.1.1 Additions.&nbsp; These requirements are to be applied so that when each successive addition is completed, the entire play area complies with all applicable provisions.&nbsp; For example, a play area is built in two phases.&nbsp; In the first phase, there are 10 elevated play components and 10 elevated play components are added in the second phase for a total of 20 elevated play components in the play area.&nbsp; When the first phase was completed, at least 5 elevated play components, including at least 3 different types, were to be provided on an accessible route.&nbsp; When the second phase is completed, at least 10 elevated play components must be located on an accessible route, and at least 7 ground level play components, including 4 different types, must be provided on an accessible route.&nbsp; At the time the second phase is complete, ramps must be used to connect at least 5 of the elevated play components and transfer systems are permitted to be used to connect the rest of the elevated play components required to be located on an accessible route.</p>

<div class="advisory">
<p class="first">Advisory F240.2.1 Ground Level Play Components.&nbsp; Examples of ground level play components may include spring rockers, swings, diggers, and stand-alone slides.&nbsp; When distinguishing between the different types of ground level play components, consider the general experience provided by the play component.&nbsp; Examples of different types of experiences include, but are not limited to, rocking, swinging, climbing, spinning, and sliding.&nbsp; A spiral slide may provide a slightly different experience from a straight slide, but sliding is the general experience and therefore a spiral slide is not considered a different type of play component from a straight slide.</p>
<p>Ground level play components accessed by children with disabilities must be integrated into the play area.&nbsp; Designers should consider the optimal layout of ground level play components accessed by children with disabilities to foster interaction and socialization among all children. Grouping all ground level play components accessed by children with disabilities in one location is not considered integrated.</p>
<p>Where a stand-alone slide is provided, an accessible route must connect the base of the stairs at the entry point to the exit point of the slide.&nbsp; A ramp or transfer system to the top of the slide is not required.&nbsp; Where a sand box is provided, an accessible route must connect to the border of the sand box.&nbsp; Accessibility to the sand box would be enhanced by providing a transfer system into the sand or by providing a raised sand table with knee clearance complying with <a href="#aba-1008_4_3" class="navSectionLink">1008.4.3</a>.</p>
<p>Ramps are preferred over transfer systems since not all children who use wheelchairs or other mobility devices may be able to use, or may choose not to use, transfer systems.</p>
<p>Where ramps connect elevated play components, the maximum rise of any ramp run is limited to 12 inches (305 mm). Where possible, designers and operators are encouraged to provide ramps with a slope less than the 1:12 maximum. Berms or sculpted dirt may be used to provide elevation and may be part of an accessible route to composite play structures.</p>

  <p class="advisory">Advisory 502.3.3 Marking.&nbsp; The method and color of marking are not specified by these requirements but may be addressed by State or local laws or regulations.&nbsp; Because these requirements permit the van access aisle to be as wide as a parking space, it is important that the aisle be clearly marked.</p>

<p>Access aisles shall not overlap the vehicular way.&nbsp; Access aisles shall be permitted to be placed on either side of the parking space except for angled van parking spaces which shall have access aisles located on the passenger side of the parking spaces.</p>
  <p class="advisory">Advisory 502.3.4 Location.&nbsp; Wheelchair lifts typically are installed on the passenger side of vans.&nbsp; Many drivers, especially those who operate vans, find it more difficult to back into parking spaces than to back out into comparatively unrestricted vehicular lanes.&nbsp; For this reason, where a van and car share an access aisle, consider locating the van space so that the access aisle is on the passenger side of the van space.</p>

  <h3 id="aba-706_1">706.1 General</h3>
<p>Assistive listening systems required in assembly areas shall comply with <a href="#aba-706" class="navSectionLink">706</a>.</p>
  <div class="advisory">
  <p class="first">Advisory 706.1 General.&nbsp; Assistive listening systems are generally categorized by their mode of transmission.&nbsp; There are hard-wired systems and three types of wireless systems: induction loop, infrared, and FM radio transmission.&nbsp; Each has different advantages and disadvantages that can help determine which system is best for a given application.&nbsp; For example, an FM system may be better than an infrared system in some open-air assemblies since infrared signals are less effective in sunlight.&nbsp; On the other hand, an infrared system is typically a better choice than an FM system where confidential transmission is important because it will be contained within a given space.</p>
  <p>The technical standards for assistive listening systems describe minimum performance levels for volume, interference, and distortion.&nbsp; Sound pressure levels (SPL), expressed in decibels, measure output sound volume.&nbsp; Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR or S/N), also expressed in decibels, represents the relationship between the loudness of a desired sound (the signal) and the background noise in a space or piece of equipment.&nbsp; The higher the SNR, the more intelligible the signal.&nbsp; The peak clipping level limits the distortion in signal output produced when high-volume sound waves are manipulated to serve assistive listening devices.</p>
  <p class="last">Selecting or specifying an effective assistive listening system for a large or complex venue requires assistance from a professional sound engineer.&nbsp; The Access Board has published technical assistance on assistive listening devices and systems.</p>
  </div>
