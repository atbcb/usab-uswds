<p>2.&nbsp; Edge protection shall be permitted at the continuous clear openings, provided that it is 4 inches (100 mm) high maximum and 2 inches (51 mm) wide maximum.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; In existing piers, clear pier space shall be permitted to be located perpendicular to the boat slip and shall extend the width of the boat slip, where the facility has at least one boat slip complying with 1003.3, and further compliance with 1003.3 would result in a reduction in the number of boat slips available or result in a reduction of the widths of existing slips.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory 1003.3.1 Boat Slip Clearance Exception 3. Where the conditions in exception 3 are satisfied, existing facilities are only required to have one&nbsp;<cite style="font-style: normal;" title="A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with this part.">accessible</cite>&nbsp;boat slip with a pier clearance which runs the length of the slip. All other&nbsp;<cite style="font-style: normal;" title="A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with this part.">accessible</cite>&nbsp;slips are allowed to have the required pier clearance at the head of the slip. Under this exception, at piers with perpendicular boat slips, the width of most "finger piers" will remain unchanged. However, where mooring systems for floating piers are replaced as part of pier&nbsp;<cite style="font-style: normal;" title="A change to a building or facility that affects or could affect the usability of the building or facility or portion thereof.&nbsp; Alteration include, but are not limited to, remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, historic restoration, resurfacing of circulation paths or vehicular ways, changes or rearrangement of the structural parts or elements, and changes or rearrangement in the plan configuration of walls and full-height partitions.&nbsp; Normal maintenance, reroofing, painting or wallpapering, or changes to mechanical and electrical systems are not alterations unless they affect the usability of the building or facility.">alteration</cite>&nbsp;projects, an opportunity may exist for increasing&nbsp;<cite style="font-style: normal;" title="A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with this part.">accessibility</cite>.

<p id="a10041">1004.1 Clear Floor Space.&nbsp; Exercise machines and equipment shall have a clear floor space complying with 305 positioned for transfer or for use by an individual seated in a wheelchair. Clear floor or ground spaces required at exercise machines and equipment shall be permitted to overlap.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory 1004.1 Clear Floor Space.&nbsp; One clear floor or ground space is permitted to be shared between two pieces of exercise equipment.&nbsp; To optimize space use, designers should carefully consider layout options such as connecting ends of the row and center aisle spaces.&nbsp; The position of the clear floor space may vary greatly depending on the use of the equipment or machine.&nbsp; For example, to provide access to a shoulder press machine, clear floor space next to the seat would be appropriate to allow for transfer.&nbsp; Clear floor space for a bench press machine designed for use by an individual seated in a wheelchair, however, will most likely be centered on the operating mechanisms.</p>
