##### Background

The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access
Board) is responsible for developing accessibility guidelines to ensure
that new construction and alterations of facilities subject to the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.)
and the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151 et
seq.) are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with
disabilities. The ADA applies to state and local governments, places of
public accommodation, and commercial facilities. The ABA applies to
facilities designed, built, altered, or leased with Federal funds.

In separate rulemakings, the Board is developing accessibility
guidelines for outdoor developed areas, including trails, and
accessibility guidelines for pedestrian facilities in the public
right-of-way, including sidewalks.

The Board issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for the outdoor
developed areas accessibility guidelines, including trails, under the
ABA in 2007. 72 FR 34074 (June 20, 2007). The NPRM was based on a
consensus report containing recommended accessibility guidelines for
trails and other outdoor elements from the Board\'s Regulatory
Negotiation Committee on Outdoor Developed Areas. The Board made
available for public review a draft of the final outdoor developed areas
accessibility guidelines in 2009. The NPRM and draft of the final
outdoor developed areas accessibility guidelines included technical
provisions for trails. References in this notice to the \"Trails
Guidelines\" refer to the 2009 draft of the final outdoor developed
areas accessibility guidelines.

The Board will issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for
pedestrian facilities in the public rights-of-way accessibility
guidelines, including sidewalks, in the summer of 2011. The Board made
available for public review drafts of the proposed public rights-of-way
accessibility guidelines in 2002 and 2005. The drafts of the proposed
public rights-of-way accessibility guidelines included technical
provisions for pedestrian access routes within sidewalks. References in
this notice to the \"Pedestrian Access Route -- Sidewalk Guidelines\"
refer to the 2005 draft of the proposed public rights-of-way
accessibility guidelines.

Public comments received during these rulemakings raised questions about
applying the technical provisions for trails and pedestrian access
routes within sidewalks to shared use paths. Commenters recommended that
the Board develop specific accessibility guidelines for shared use paths
that address their unique characteristics. The Board agrees that shared
use paths differ sufficiently from trails and sidewalks to warrant
specific guidelines for making them accessible.

**Applicability**

Like all of the Board\'s accessibility guidelines, the guidelines for
shared use paths will apply to newly constructed and altered facilities.
When the Board\'s final guidelines are adopted by other Federal agencies
authorized to issue ADA or ABA standards, they will be enforceable. 1
The Board\'s guidelines do not address existing facilities unless the
facilities are included in the scope of an alteration undertaken at the
discretion of a covered entity. The Department of Justice has issued
separate regulations on program accessibility for State and local
governments and on barrier removal for places of public accommodation
owned or operated by private entities that address existing facilities
that are not altered. 28 CFR 35.150 and 28 CFR 36.304. When the
Department of Justice initiates rulemaking to adopt the shared use path
accessibility guidelines as accessibility standards, the Department of
Justice will address how program accessibility and barrier removal apply
to existing shared use paths that are not altered. Comments concerning
shared use paths that are not altered should be directed to the
Department of Justice when it initiates rulemaking to adopt the shared
use path accessibility guidelines as accessibility standards.

**Key Differences between Shared Use Paths, Trails, Sidewalks, and
Accessible Routes**

Shared use paths are a type of trail designed to be part of a
transportation system, providing off-road routes for a variety of
users.  The primary users of shared use paths are bicyclists and
pedestrians, including pedestrians using mobility devices such as manual
or motorized wheelchairs.  While they may coincidently provide a
recreational experience, shared use paths differ from other types of
trails with their transportation focus and serving as a supplement to
on-road bike lanes, shared roadways, bike boulevards, and paved
shoulders. They may extend or complement a roadway network. Shared use
path design is similar to roadway design but on a smaller scale and for
lower speeds.  Whether located within a highway right-of-way, provided
along a riverbank, or established over natural terrain within an
independent right-of-way, shared use paths differ from sidewalks and
trails in that they are primarily designed for bicyclists and others for
transportation purposes such as commuting to work.

Trails, on the other hand, are designed primarily for recreational
purposes.  Since they are not designed with a transportation focus, they
are typically not parallel to a roadway. Trails are pedestrian routes
developed primarily for outdoor recreational purposes and do not connect
elements, spaces, or facilities within a site. Trails are largely
designed for pedestrians and other users to \"experience\" the outdoors
and may be used by a variety of users, but they are not designed for
transportation purposes.

Sidewalks are located in a public right-of-way and typically are
parallel to a roadway. Consequently, sidewalk grades (running slopes)
must be generally consistent with roadway grades so that they fit into
the right-of-way.  Sidewalks are designed for pedestrians and are not
designed for bicycles or other recreational purposes. 

**American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials
(AASHTO) Guide on Bicycle Facilities and Shared Use Paths**

The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials
(AASHTO) advocates transportation-related policies and provides
technical services to support states in their efforts to efficiently and
safely move people and goods. AASHTO develops and publishes more than
125 volumes of standards and guidelines that are used worldwide in the
design, construction, maintenance, operation, and administration of
highways, bridges, and other transportation facilities. AASHTO is
considered a leading source of information related to the design and
construction of pedestrian and bicycle facilities. The Board has worked
closely with AASHTO over the years in developing accessibility criteria
for pedestrian facilities and shared use paths. AASHTO developed the
\"Guide for the Planning, Design, and Operation of Pedestrian
Facilities\" (July 2004) and the \"Guide for the Development of Bicycle
Facilities\" (1999). Although compliance with these AASHTO documents is
voluntary, many states adopt these AASHTO documents as standards.

In February 2010, AASHTO made available draft revisions to the 1999
\"Guide for the Development of Bicycle Facilities.\" The February 2010
draft is named the \"Guide for Planning, Design, and Operation of
Bicycle Facilities.\" References in this notice to the AASHTO Bicycle
Facilities Guide refer to the February 2010 draft of the \"Guide for
Guide for Planning, Design, and Operation of Bicycle Facilities.\"
Chapter 5 of the AASHTO Bicycle Facilities Guide contains technical
provisions for shared use paths. Chapter 5 applies a combination of the
technical provisions in Board\'s Trails Guidelines and Pedestrian Access
Route -- Sidewalk Guidelines to shared use paths. The Board\'s
rulemaking on shared use paths is timely given AASHTO\'s current plan to
revise its guide for bicycle facilities and shared use paths. This
rulemaking presents an opportunity for AASHTO and the Board to
coordinate their efforts. AASHTO and the Board share a common interest
in providing clear and consistent technical provisions for designers,
owners and operators of shared use paths. The Board welcomes this
opportunity.

**Information Meeting on Shared Use Paths**

On September 13, 2010, the Board held a public information meeting in
conjunction with the ProWalk/ProBike 2010 Conference convened by the
National Center for Bicycling and Walking. This was an opportunity for
individuals with disabilities, designers of shared use paths, and other
interested parties to provide information to assist the Access Board to
consider how best to approach the development of accessibility
guidelines for shared use paths. The meeting featured representatives
from the State of Washington Department of Transportation, Florida
Department of Transportation, AASHTO, and the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA). Meeting participants addressed major issues,
including how to define shared use paths and possible technical
provisions. Input from this meeting is reflected in this notice.

**Request for Public Comment**

The Board seeks input from the public, including individuals with
disabilities, and from representatives of Federal, state, or local
governments, public transportation organizations, and industry
professionals regarding matters covered in this notice. In particular,
the Board invites comments on the draft definition of \"shared use
path\" and draft technical provisions in this document. Please provide
responses to the specific questions included in the notice and provide
any additional information that may assist the Board to further refine
the draft definition and technical provisions.

**Shared Use Path Definition**

Given the similarity between exterior pedestrian routes, including
shared use paths, sidewalks, trails, and accessible routes, it is
important to define the term \"shared use path\" used in this document
in order to minimize any potential confusion regarding applicable
accessibility criteria.

To accomplish this, the Board has developed a draft definition for
\"shared use path.\" AASHTO and several city, state, and Federal
agencies have developed definitions; however, currently there is no
universally accepted definition. The table below includes some of those
definitions.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

In related rulemaking, the Board developed a definition for \"trails\"
in the Trails Guidelines and will reference the 2009 Manual of Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) definition of \"sidewalks\" in the
Pedestrian Access Route -- Sidewalk Guidelines. These definitions are
provided below for comparison to the above definitions of \"shared use
path.\"

*Trail.* A pedestrian route developed primarily for outdoor recreational
purposes. A pedestrian route developed primarily to connect elements,
spaces, or facilities within a site is not a trail. (Trails Guidelines,
Section F106.5)

*Sidewalk.* That portion of a street between the curb line, or the
lateral line of a roadway, and the adjacent property line or on
easements of private property that is paved or improved and intended for
use by pedestrians. (2009 MUTCD Section 1A.13.192)

Participants attending the information meeting in September 2010 held in
conjunction with the ProWalk/ProBike meeting noted the need for a
definition of \"shared use path.\" They identified the key
characteristics of a shared use path. The focus on a \"transportation\"
purpose and \"multi-use\" were found to be primary factors
distinguishing shared use paths from sidewalks and trails. Shared use
paths are designed primarily for bicycles and pedestrians. The Board has
used this input to develop the draft definition below.

*Shared Use Path.* A shared use path is a multi-use path designed for
both transportation and recreation purposes. Shared use paths typically
are separated from motorized vehicular traffic by an open space or
barrier, either within a highway right-of-way or within an independent
right-of-way.

Shared use paths are used by pedestrians and bicyclists, joggers,
skaters, wheelchair users (both nonmotorized and motorized),
equestrians, and other nonmotorized users. The draft definition does not
include a list of all the groups that may use a shared use path. The
purpose of the definition is to clarify when to apply the scoping and
technical provisions for these paths. Local jurisdictions have authority
to establish permissible uses on shared use paths. The Department of
Justice (DOJ) ADA regulations require local jurisdictions to permit
individuals with mobility disabilities to use manually-operated and
power-driven wheelchairs in any areas open to the public. See 28 CFR
§35.137 (a) as amended on September 15, 2010 (75 FR 56178). The DOJ ADA
regulations further require local jurisdictions to establish policies
regarding the use of other power-driven mobility devices by individuals
with mobility disabilities subject to legitimate safety requirements.
See 28 CFR §35.137 (b) as amended on September 15, 2010 (75 FR 56178).
FHWA has issued similar guidance regarding use of other power-driven
mobility devices by individuals with mobility disabilities on pedestrian
routes funded with Federal-aid highway funds. See
<http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/bikeped/framework.htm>.

*Question 1.* Does the draft definition of \"shared use path\"
sufficiently distinguish these paths from trails and sidewalks? If not,
please provide any recommendations that would strengthen this
distinction.

**Draft Technical Provisions for Shared Use Paths**

Based on input at the information meeting in September 2010 and other
sources, the Board has developed draft technical provisions for shared
use paths and invites public comment. Discussion follows each of the
draft technical provisions. For some of the draft provisions, we have
provided tables showing corresponding provisions for sidewalks in the
Pedestrian Access Route -- Sidewalk Guidelines; trails in the Trails
Guidelines; and shared use paths in the February 2010 draft AASHTO
Bicycle Facilities Guide. The draft technical provisions establish
criteria for the following components of a shared use path: surface;
changes in level (vertical alignment and surface discontinuities);
horizontal openings; width; grade and cross slope; protruding objects;
gates and barriers; and intersections and curb ramps.

*Question 2.* What technical provisions, if any, should apply where
separate unpaved paths are provided for equestrian use? Additional
information and guidance on this issue is welcomed.

**1. Surface**

*Surface.* The surface of the shared use path shall be firm, stable, and
slip resistant.

A firm, stable, and slip resistant surface is necessary for persons with
disabilities using wheeled mobility devices. Bicyclists with
narrow-tired bicycles and in-line skaters also need a hard, durable
surface. Shared use paths typically are comprised of asphalt or concrete
and these surfaces are generally accessible for people with
disabilities. These surfaces perform well in inclement weather and
require minimal maintenance. Unpaved surfaces that are firm, stable, and
slip resistant may be used; however, they may erode over time requiring
regular maintenance.

  SURFACE                                                      PROVISIONS
  ------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Access Board Pedestrian Access Route - Sidewalk Guidelines   Firm, stable, and slip resistant
  Access Board Trail Guidelines                                Firm and stable
  AASHTO Bicycle Facilities Guide                              Hard, durable surface such as asphalt or Portland cement concrete recommended.

**2. Changes in Level**

*Vertical Alignment.* Vertical alignment shall be planar within curb
ramp runs, blended transitions, landings, and gutter areas within the
shared use path. Grade breaks shall be flush. Where the shared use path
crosses rail tracks at grade, the surface of the shared use path shall
be level and flush with the top of the rail at the outer edges of the
rail. The surface between the rails shall be aligned with the top of the
rail.

*Surface Discontinuities.* Surface discontinuities shall not exceed 0.50
inch (13 mm) maximum. Vertical discontinuities between 0.25 inch (6.4
mm) and 0.5 inch (13 mm) maximum shall be beveled at 1:2 maximum. The
bevel shall be applied across the entire level change.

In addition to firm, stable, and slip resistant surfaces, smooth
surfaces are also necessary for the safe use of wheeled mobility
devices, as well as bicycles and in-line skaters. The draft technical
provisions allow vertical changes in level up to 1/4 inch without
treatment and other vertical changes in level from 1/4 to 1/2 inch if
they are beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2. Surfaces with
individual units laid out of plane and those that are heavily textured,
rough, or chamfered, will greatly increase rolling resistance and will
subject pedestrians who use wheelchairs, scooters, and rolling walkers
to the stressful (and often painful) effects of vibration. Surface
discontinuities are also dangerous for bicyclists and in-line skaters.
It is highly desirable to minimize surface discontinuities. However,
when discontinuities are unavoidable, they should be widely separated.

**3. Horizontal Openings**

*Joints and Gratings.* Openings shall not permit passage of a sphere
more than 0.5 inch (13 mm) in diameter. Elongated openings shall be
placed so that the long dimension is perpendicular to the dominant
direction of travel.

*Flangeway Gaps at Non-Freight Rail Crossings.* Openings for wheel
flanges at pedestrian crossings of non-freight rail track shall be 2.5
inches (64 mm) maximum.

*Flangeway Gaps at Freight Rail Crossings.* Openings for wheel flanges
at pedestrian crossings of freight rail track shall be 3 inches (75 mm)
maximum.

Surface openings or gaps must be minimized in order to ensure a smooth
surface on shared-use paths. Utility covers and drainage grates can be
hazards and, for the safety of all users, must be treated. Special
treatment is necessary where shared use paths cross railroad crossings,
both freight and non-freight for the safe passage of wheeled mobility
devices, as well as bicycles and other users. The AASHTO Bicycle
Facilities Guide recommends that railroad crossings be smooth and be
designed at an angle between 60 and 90 degrees to the direction of
travel in order to minimize the danger of falls.

The draft technical provisions for surface gaps in shared use paths are
consistent with the draft provisions in the Pedestrian Access Route -
Sidewalk Guidelines. In most cases, the guidelines will require surface
gaps or openings on shared use paths to be no wider than 1/2 inch.
However, this specification is not practicable at rail tracks where gaps
must be at least 2 1/2 inches to safely accommodate rail car wheel
flanges. Due to variations in load and wheel play, the gap must be even
larger (3 inches) to accommodate heavy freight trains. The Board is
aware that such a gap can trap wheelchair caster wheels which are prone
to turning sideways against vertical displacements, even slight ones but
is unaware of a way to resolve this conflict.

**4. Width**

*Width.* The clear width of shared use paths shall be 5 feet (1.5 m)
minimum.

The AASHTO Bicycle Facilities Guide recommends the paved width for a
shared use path to be 10 feet minimum. Typically, widths range from 10
to 14 feet with the wider ranges in areas with high use or when planning
for a wider variety of user groups. In very rare circumstances, a
reduced width of 8 feet may be used. Wider shared use paths also are
recommended where the path is used by larger maintenance vehicles; on
steep grades to provide additional passing area; or through curves to
provide more operating space.

The Board is considering requiring accessible shared use paths to
provide at least 5 feet minimum width to address those rare
circumstances where the AASHTO Bicycle Facilities Guide is not applied
so that sufficient space is provided for wheelchair turning and to allow
wheelchair users and others to pass one another.

  WIDTH                                                        PROVISIONS
  ------------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------
  Access Board Pedestrian Access Route - Sidewalk Guidelines   4 feet minimum
  Access Board Trail Guidelines                                3 feet minimum
  AASHTO Bicycle Facilities Guide                              10 feet minimum (in rare cases, 8 feet minimum)

\
**5. Grade and Cross Slope**

*Grade.* The maximum grade of a shared use path shall be 5 percent.\
*Exception:* Where the shared use path is contained within a street or
highway border, its grade shall not exceed the general grade established
for the adjacent street or highway.

Individuals with disabilities using wheeled mobility devices generally
need less steep slopes in order to conserve energy and to better
maintain control of the wheeled mobility device. For these reasons, the
Board is considering a 5 percent maximum grade on newly constructed and
altered shared paths that are not contained within a street or highway
border. The AASHTO Bicycle Facilities Guide recommends that grades
greater than 5 percent are undesirable for a variety of reasons.
Bicyclists may find ascents over-taxing and descents uncomfortable where
speed is likely to build. Steep grades affect the safety of all users,
particularly where multiple types of users are on the path at the same
time. For example, pedestrians with disabilities may have difficulty
avoiding faster moving bicycles. More importantly, however, pedestrians
with disabilities are likely to experience greater difficulty traveling
on steeper slopes than others.

| AASHTO Bicycle Facilities Guide   | Grades greater than 5 percent are |
|                                   | undesirable.                      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

*Question 3.* Are there conditions where a 5 percent maximum grade
cannot be achieved on a newly constructed shared use path? If so, the
Board is interested in a description of the specific conditions that
might prevent compliance. The Board will consider providing additional
exceptions where it may be difficult or impossible to meet the 5 percent
maximum grade.

*Question 4.* Should the Board provide guidance on how to address
steeper segments of shared use paths when they cannot be avoided? For
example, would providing space for bicyclists or wheelchair users to
move off of the shared use path in order to avoid conflict with other
traffic be helpful?

Where the shared use path is contained within a street or highway
border, the grade may not exceed the general grade established for the
adjacent street or highway. This is consistent with the grade provisions
for sidewalks.

*Question 5.* What would be considered a sufficient separation between a
shared use path and a roadway, or outside border of a roadway, where it
may not be necessary for the shared use path to follow the grade of the
roadway?

*Cross Slope.* The maximum cross slope shall be 2 percent.

Excessive cross slope (exceeding 2 percent) is a major barrier to travel
along shared use paths for individuals using wheeled mobility devices
and can significantly impede forward progress on an uphill slope and
compromise control and balance in downhill travel and on turns. Cross
slope also negatively affects pedestrians who have braces or lower-limb
prostheses and may use walkers or crutches, and those with gait,
balance, and stamina impairments. Energy that might otherwise be used in
forward travel must be expended to resist the perpendicular force of a
cross slope along a route of travel. The AASHTO Bicycle Facilities Guide
recommends a one percent cross slope, particularly at turns where
bicyclists tend to lean to one side while turning. A one percent cross
slope also provides sufficient slope to convey surface drainage in most
situations.

*Question 6.* Are there conditions where cross slope steeper than 2
percent is necessary in new construction? If so, the Board is interested
in a description of these specific conditions and recommendations for
appropriate allowances.

**6. Protruding Objects**

*Protruding Objects.* Protruding objects along or overhanging any
portion of the shared use path shall not reduce the clear width of the
shared use paths.

*Protrusion Limits.* Objects with leading edges more than 27 inches (685
mm) and not more than 80 inches (2 m) above the finish surface or ground
shall not protrude more than 4 inches (100 mm) horizontally into shared
use paths.

*Post-Mounted Objects.* Where objects are mounted on free-standing posts
or pylons and the objects are 27 inches (685 mm) minimum and 80 inches
(2030 mm) maximum above the finish surface or ground, the objects shall
not overhang shared use paths more than 4 inches (100 mm) beyond the
post or pylon base measured 6 inches (150 mm) minimum above the finish
surface or ground. Where a sign or other obstruction is mounted between
posts or pylons and the clear distance between the posts or pylons is
greater than 12 inches (305 mm) the lowest edge of sign or obstruction
shall be 27 inches (685 mm) maximum or 80 inches (2 m) minimum above the
finish surface or ground.

The draft technical provisions for protruding objects are derived from
the Board\'s ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines and Pedestrian Access
Route -- Sidewalk Guidelines. The provisions addresses objects that may
project into shared use paths in a manner hazardous to people with
vision impairments. Any protrusion on a shared use path is considered
hazardous for all users, including individuals with disabilities. These
technical provisions would apply to the full width of the shared use
path. Objects mounted on walls or posts with leading edges above the
standard sweep of canes (27 inches) and below the standard head room
clearance (80 inches) would be limited to a 4 inch protrusion.

**7. Gates and Barriers**

*Clear Width.* Where gates or other barriers are provided, openings in
gates and barriers shall provide a clear width of 32 inches (815 mm)
minimum.

*Gate Hardware.* Gate hardware shall be operable with one hand and shall
not require tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist. The
force required to activate operable parts shall be 5 pounds (22.2 N)
maximum. Operable parts of such hardware shall be 34 inches (865 mm)
minimum and 48 inches (1220 mm) maximum above the finish surface or
ground.

The draft technical provisions for gates and barriers are based on the
Board\'s ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines and Trails Guidelines.
Gates or barriers often are wider than 32 inches to allow for the safe
passage of bicycles and other authorized users of shared use paths. The
Board is proposing to require a 32 inch minimum clearance to address the
rare circumstance where gate or barrier openings are deliberately narrow
and could restrict access by wheelchair users unless a minimum width
applies. A 32 inch wide clear opening provides the minimum clearance
necessary to allow passage of an occupied wheelchair or other mobility
device. The operation and location provisions for gate hardware are
necessary to ensure that individuals with disabilities can operate the
hardware.

**8. Intersections and Curb Ramps**

*Curb Ramps and Blended Transitions*

*Curb Ramps.* Curb ramps shall have a running slope that cuts through or
is built up to the curb at right angles or meets the gutter grade break
at right angles.

*Running Slope.* The running slope of curb ramps shall be 5 percent
minimum and 8.3 percent maximum but shall not require the ramp length to
exceed 15 ft. (4.5 m).

*Cross Slope.* The cross slope of a curb ramp at intersections shall be
2 percent maximum. The cross slope of a curb ramp at midblock crossings
shall be permitted to be equal to the street or highway grade.

*Landing.* A landing 4 feet (1.2 m) minimum by 4 feet (1.2 m) minimum
shall be provided at the top of the curb ramp and shall be permitted to
overlap other landings and clear space. The running and cross slope of a
curb ramp at midblock crossings shall be permitted to be equal to the
street or highway grade.

*Blended Transitions.* Where blended transitions are provided, the
running slope shall be 5 percent maximum and cross slope shall be 2
percent maximum.

*Common Technical Provisions for Curb Ramps and Blended Transitions.*

*Width.* The clear width of blended transitions and curb ramps,
excluding flares, shall be at least as wide as the shared use path

*Detectable Warning Surfaces.* Detectable warning surfaces shall be
provided where a shared use path connects to or crosses a roadway or
railway crossing.

*Grade Breaks.* Grade breaks at the top and bottom of curb ramps shall
be perpendicular to the direction of the ramp run. At least one end of
the bottom grade break shall be at the back of curb. Grade breaks shall
not be permitted on the surface of curb ramps, blended transitions,
landings, and gutter areas within the shared use path. Surface slopes
that meet at grade breaks shall be flush.

*Counter Slopes.* The counter slope of the gutter or street at the foot
of a curb ramp, landing, or blended transition shall be 5 percent
maximum.

*Clear Space.* Beyond the curb face, a clear space of 4 feet (1.2 m)
minimum by 4 feet. (1.2 m) minimum shall be provided within the width of
the crossing.

*Detectable Warning Surfaces*

*Truncated Domes.* Detectable warning surfaces shall consist of
truncated domes aligned in a square or radial grid pattern.

*Dome Size.* Truncated domes in detectable warning surfaces shall have a
base diameter of 0.9 inch (23 mm) minimum to 1.4 inches (36 mm) maximum,
a top diameter of 50 percent of the base diameter minimum to 65 percent
of the base diameter maximum, and a height of 0.2 inch (5 mm).

*Dome Spacing.* Truncated domes in a detectable warning surface shall
have a center-to-center spacing of 1.6 inches (41 mm) minimum and 2.4
inches (61 mm) maximum, and a base-to-base spacing of 0.65 inches (17
mm) minimum, measured between the most adjacent domes.

*Contrast.* Detectable warning surfaces shall contrast visually with
adjacent gutter, street or highway, or shared use path surfaces, either
light-on-dark or dark-on-light.

*Size*. Detectable warning surfaces shall extend 24 inches (610 mm)
minimum in the direction of travel and the full width of the curb ramp
or the blended transition.

*Location and Alignment of Detectable Warning Surfaces*

*Curb Ramps.* Where both ends of the bottom grade break are 5.0 feet
(1.5 m) or less from the back of curb, the detectable warning surfaces
shall be located on the ramp surface at the bottom grade break. Where
either end of the bottom grade break is more than 5.0 feet (1.5 m) from
the back of curb, the detectable warning surfaces shall be located on
the lower landing.

*Blended Transitions.* The detectable warning surfaces shall be located
on the blended transition at the back of curb.

*Rail Crossings.* The detectable warning surfaces shall be located so
that the edge nearest the rail crossing is 6 feet (1.8 m) minimum and 15
feet (4.6 m) maximum from the centerline of the nearest rail. The rows
of truncated domes in a detectable warning surface shall be aligned to
be parallel with the direction of pedestrian travel.

Treatment of elevation changes, such as at curbs, and controlling cross
slope are key factors in ensuring accessibility, particularly where
shared use paths and roadways intersect. The draft technical provisions
for curb ramps, blended transitions, and detectable warnings are based
on the Board\'s Pedestrian Access Route -- Sidewalk Guidelines. In
general, the draft provisions for shared use paths require the
following.

-   The opening of a shared use path at a roadway must be at least as
    wide as the shared use path itself;
-   A curb ramp or blended transition must be provided, and must be the
    full width of the shared use path;
-   The running slope of the curb ramp must not exceed 8.3 percent and
    blended transition must not exceed 5 percent;
-   The cross slope must be the same as the running slope of the roadway
    at midblock crossings; and
-   Where the shared use path crosses a roadway or railway, detectable
    warnings must be provided the full width of the curb ramp or blended
    transition for a depth of 2 feet.

Markings at crossings of shared use paths and roadways must also comply
with the provisions of Part 3 - Markings of the 2009 Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).

The Board has limited the requirement for detectable warnings to
locations where a shared use path crosses a roadway or a railway. The
Board has not included a requirement for detectable warnings where
shared use paths cross other paths or pedestrian facilities. Where
pedestrians and bicyclists share a pathway, established bicycle and
pedestrian \"rules of the road\" should provide sufficient guidance for
safe use.

*Question 7.* Is there a need to provide additional warnings or
information to bicyclists regarding potential conflicts with other
shared use paths users, including pedestrians with disabilities?

**9. Other Issues**

*Overlap of Trails, Sidewalks, and Shared Use Paths*

In some locations, a shared use path may be part of a sidewalk, or part
of a trail. Guidance is needed to clarify which set of guidelines should
be applied where there is overlap since the technical provisions are
different in some areas. For example, Pedestrian Access Route - Sidewalk
Guidelines permit the grade to follow the slope of the roadway and
Trails Guidelines specify a maximum grade. The Board is interested in
suggestions for ways to treat areas of shared use paths that overlap
sidewalks and trails that will provide an acceptable level of
accessibility while taking into consideration any unique conditions or
situations that may occur where these routes overlap.

*Question 8.* What technical provisions should apply where the shared
use path overlaps a trail or sidewalk?

*Shared Use Path Connections*

The draft technical provisions in this ANPRM apply to the newly
constructed and altered shared use paths. Shared use paths may be
constructed over many miles and connected with other pedestrian routes,
creating a network for transportation purposes. The Board is interested
in more information regarding connections between shared use paths and
other parts of a transportation network.

*Question 9*. Are different technical provisions needed when applying
the draft technical provisions for shared use paths that \"connect\"
shared use paths together or with other pedestrian routes (e.g.,
sidewalks, trails, accessible routes)? If so, please provide any
additional information or recommendations.

*Where Should the Accessibility Guidelines for Shared Use Paths Be
Located?\
*

The Board is considering including the accessibility guidelines for
shared use paths in the same document as the accessibility guidelines
for pedestrian facilities in the public right-of-way. State and local
government departments of transportation appear to be the principal
entities that design and construct shared use paths since these
facilities are an extension of the transportation network, and having
the accessibility guidelines for shared use paths in the same document
as pedestrian facilities in the public right-of-way appears to be a
logical choice. In addition, many of the draft technical provisions for
shared use paths (i.e., intersection and curb ramps/blended transitions,
detectable warning surfaces, 4 inch limit on post-mounted protruding
objects (signs),  and rail flangeway gaps) are the same as those in
draft guidelines for pedestrian facilities in the public-right-of-way. 

*Question 10.* Should the accessibility guidelines for shared use paths
be included in the same document as the accessibility guidelines for
pedestrian facilities in the public right-of-way?

*Question 11.* Are there other issues that need to be addressed by the
accessibility guidelines for shared use paths? If so, please provide
specific information on any additional areas that should be addressed in
the guidelines.

**Regulatory Process Matters**

The Board will prepare regulatory assessments required by Executive
Orders 12866 and 13563, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act as a part of
a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), the next step in this
rulemaking.

*Question 12.* The Board requests commenters to provide information for
the regulatory assessments, including:

-   Number of existing and planned shared-use paths at the state or
    national level;
-   Number of shared-use paths constructed each year (on average) within
    your jurisdiction;
-   Typical cost for a new shared-use path on a per-mile basis;
-   Sources of funding for the construction of shared-use paths (e.g.,
    Federal highway funds, other Federal grant programs, state funds,
    local funds);
-   The extent to which the AASHTO Bicycle Facilities Guide, or other
    design guides and standards are used for shared use paths;
-   Whether any of the draft technical provisions would result in
    additional costs for design work, materials, earthmoving, retaining
    structures, or other items compared to current construction
    practices or design guides and standards currently followed;
-   What, if any, unintended consequences (positive or negative) could
    result from an agency adopting the guidelines, and
-   What impacts will the draft technical provisions have on small
    entities and are there alternatives that would minimize those
    impacts?
