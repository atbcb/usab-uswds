La ABA requiere acceso a instalaciones diseñadas, construidas, alteradas, o alquiladas con fondos federales. Aprobada por el Congreso en 1968, la ley marca uno de los primeros esfuerzos para garantizar el acceso a las zonas edificadas. El Consejo de Acceso desarrolla y mantiene las directrices de accesibilidad bajo esta ley. Estas directrices sirven como base para los estándares utilizados para aplicar la ley. Cuatro agencias federales son responsables de estas normas: el Departamento de Defensa; el Departamento de Vivienda y Desarrollo Urbano; la Administración de Servicios Generales; y el Servicio Postal de los Estados Unidos.

Las agencias federales tienen la responsabilidad de garantizar el cumplimiento de las normas de ABA al financiar el diseño, construcción, alteración, o alquiler de instalaciones. El Consejo fue establecido bajo la Sección 502 de la Ley de Rehabilitación de 1973, con el propósito de aplicar la ABA, que lo hace a través de la investigación de las denuncias. Cualquier persona preocupada por la accesibilidad de las instalaciones que pueden haber recibido fondos federales puede presentar una denuncia ante el Consejo.

Presidente Lyndon Johnson, quien promulgó la ABA en agosto de 1968, caracterizó barreras para acceso como fracasos por parte del gobierno que perpetuaban “la discriminacion cruel.”
