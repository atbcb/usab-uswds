### About the 2013 _Draft_ Accessibility Guidelines for the Public Right-of-Way

These 2013 draft guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) address access to sidewalks and streets, crosswalks, curb ramps, pedestrian signals, on-street parking, and other components of public rights-of-way.  These draft guidelines also review shared use paths, which are designed primarily for use by bicyclists and pedestrians for transportation and recreation purposes.
