<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>When engineers and architects work on a project that includes alterations within the rights-of-way, the construction of the curb ramps will require thought and planning. There is no standard layout for a curb ramp—each and every curb ramp is unique. The curb ramp must be designed to meet the existing topographical and physical constraints, and the requirements for curb ramp slope, cross slope, landings, and connection to the street.</p>
<p>Several factors need to be achieved to construct a curb ramp that will be usable by ALL pedestrians. For perpendicular curb ramps, the ramp slope must be perpendicular to the grade break at the gutter line. The curb ramp landing and gutter connection need to be designed and constructed so water does not pond at the base of the ramp or on the landing and debris does not accumulate. Debris and water reduce the usability of a curb ramp. The ramp and the landing need to be wide enough to be used by all users of the sidewalk system. If at all possible, the curb ramp slope needs to be aligned with the sidewalk and crosswalk to provide an additional cue to assist the visually impaired and blind persons in aligning to cross the street. Paired curb ramps on a corner allow better alignment for people using mobility aids and for pedestrians with vision impairments and make it easier to separate the APS.</p>
<p>This chapter provides examples of curb ramp designs that may be useful on 10 foot radius curb returns and 30 foot curb returns. In addition to topographical issues, width of the sidewalk and the distance between the sidewalk and curb can affect curb ramp design. Variations of these factors are also shown in the examples.</p>
<p><strong>10-foot Radius Curb Returns </strong></p>
<p><em>Example 1—Parallel Curb Ramp </em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/prowacc_curb_ramps-1_b_fmt.jpeg" alt="CAD drawing of paired parallel curb ramps in 10-foot radius corner; APS locations indicated" border="1"></p>
<p class="smalltext">Parallel Curb Ramp—5-foot sidewalk on tangents</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Provides usable curb ramps where narrow (4-5‘) sidewalk is at back of curb.</li>
<li>The use of parallel curb ramps will assist the designer to construct curb ramps where the intersecting streets have considerable grade differences.</li>
<li>Landing at gutter elevation increases possibility of ponding and accumulation of debris on the landing.</li>
<li>Layout enables area between the two curb ramps to retain some of the curb height, which assists in drainage and discourages vehicles cutting across the corner. The use of parallel curb ramps require the sidewalk to be raised/lowered to the landing. This will cause the pedestrians using the sidewalk system to go up and down several times when going through the area of the two curb ramps.</li>
<li>APS push button locator tone will assist blind or visually impaired persons in finding crossing location and the tactile arrow may provide some assistance with aligning to cross.</li>
<li>The use of paired curb ramps (a separate curb ramp and landing for each direction of crosswalk) will allow pedestrians with disabilities to be aligned with the crossing direction while waiting to cross the street.</li>
<li>Paired curb ramps help meet the separation requirements for APS.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Example 2—Parallel Curb Ramp, Large Shared Landing </em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/prowacc_curb_ramps-2_b_fmt.jpeg" alt="CAD drawing of single parallel curb ramp in 10-foot radius corner; APS locations indicated" border="1"></p>
<p class="smalltext">Blended Transition Curb Ramp—5-foot sidewalk on fan</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Provides usable curb ramps where narrow (4-5‘) sidewalk is at back of curb.</li>
<li>Layout moves the crosswalk closer to the intersection.</li>
<li>Landing at gutter elevation increases potential for ponding and accumulation of debris on the landing.</li>
<li>Slope of parallel curb ramps in sidewalk may provide a directional cue to pedestrians who are visually impaired or blind.</li>
<li>APS push button locator tone will assist blind or visually impaired persons in finding crossing location and and tactile arrow may provide some assistance with aligning to cross.</li>
<li>If landing is small, it may eliminate the ability to separate the APS push buttons and speakers by more than 10 feet. If APS pairs are closer than 10 feet, speech walk messages and additional features are needed to clarify walk indication.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Example 3—Perpendicular Curb Ramp </em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/prowacc_curb_ramps-3_b_fmt.jpeg" alt="CAD drawing of paired perpendicular curb ramps in narrow sidewalk at 10-foot radius corner; APS locations indicated" border="1"></p>
<p class="smalltext">Perpendicular Curb Ramp—5-foot sidewalk on tangents</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Provides usable curb ramps where narrow (4-5‘) sidewalk is at back of curb, if additional right-of-way is available.</li>
<li>This design will require the use of additional/available right-of-way.</li>
<li>Layout enables area between the two curb ramps to retain the curb height, which assists in drainage and discourages vehicles cutting across the corner.</li>
<li>Curb ramp must lie entirely within the crosswalk limits; flares are not part of PAR and can lie outside crosswalk markings.</li>
<li>Curb ramp slope aligned with crosswalk direction will provide a directional cue for the visually impaired and blind pedestrians, particularly when combined with tactile arrow of APS.</li>
<li>The use of paired curb ramps (a separate curb ramp and landing for each direction of crosswalk) will allow pedestrians with disabilities to be aligned with the crossing direction while waiting to cross the street.</li>
<li>Paired curb ramps will help meet the separation requirements for APS.</li>
<li>APS push button locator tones will assist blind or visually impaired persons in finding crossing location and tactile arrows may provide some assistance with aligning to cross.</li>

<p class="smalltext">Perpendicular Curb Ramp—12-foot sidewalk on tangents</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>12-foot sidewalk at back of curb provides more room for directional curb ramps.</li>
<li>Layout enables area between the two curb ramps to retain the curb height, which assists in drainage and discourages vehicles cutting across the corner.</li>
<li>Curb ramp must lie entirely within the crosswalk limits; flares are not part of PAR and can lie outside crosswalk markings.</li>

<p><img src="/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/prowacc_curb_ramps-5_b_fmt.jpeg" alt="CAD drawing of paired combination curb ramps in sidewalk with parkway at 10-foot radius corner; APS locations indicated." border="1"></p>
<p class="smalltext">Combination Curb Ramp—6-foot parkway with 6-foot sidewalk on curve</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>6-foot grass area or furnishing zone between curb and PAR provides additional space for perpendicular curb ramps.</li>
<li>Combination of parallel and perpendicular curb ramps will allow designers to adjust the elevation of the sidewalk to meet the landing. This may be required by constraints behind the sidewalk.</li>
<li>Layout enables area between the two curb ramps to retain some of the curb height, which assists in drainage and discourages vehicles cutting across the corner.</li>
<li>Curb ramp slope in line with sidewalk and crosswalks, and edge of landscaping aligned with crosswalk provides excellent direction cues to pedestrians who are blind or visually impaired.</li>
<li>Paired curb ramps will help meet the separation requirements for APS.</li>
<li>APS push button locator tone and tactile arrow will assist blind or visually impaired persons in finding crossing location and may provide some assistance with aligning to cross.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Example 6—Perpendicular Curb Ramps </em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/prowacc_curb_ramps-6_b_fmt.jpeg" alt="CAD drawing of paired perpendicular curb ramps in sidewalk with parkway at 10-foot radius corner; APS locations indicated." border="1"></p>
<p class="smalltext">Perpendicular Curb Ramp—6-foot parkway with 6-foot sidewalk on curve</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>6-foot grass area or furnishing zone between curb and PAR provides additional space for directional perpendicular curb ramps.</li>
<li>Layout enables area between the two curb ramps to retain majority of the curb height which assists in drainage and discourages vehicles cutting across the corner.</li>
<li>Curb ramp slope aligned with crosswalk direction will provide directional cue for the visually impaired and blind pedestrians, particularly when combined with tactile arrow of APS.</li>
<li>Paired curb ramps will help meet the separation requirements for APS.</li>
<li>APS push button locator tone will assist blind or visually impaired persons in finding crossing location and tactile arrow may provide some assistance with aligning to cross.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Example 7—Combination Parallel and Perpendicular Curb Ramps </em><br><em>(slope in sidewalk approach and curb ramp perpendicular to the street) </em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/prowacc_curb_ramps-7_b_fmt.jpeg" alt="CAD drawing of paired combination curb ramps in sidewalk with parkway at 10-foot radius corner; APS locations indicated." border="1"></p>
<p class="smalltext">Combination Curb Ramp—8-foot parkway with 5-foot sidewalk on curve</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Grass area or furnishing zone between curb and PAR allows room for perpendicular curb ramps.</li>
<li>Parallel ramps in sidewalk allow designer to adjust the elevation of the sidewalk to meet the landing. This may assist in areas where there are constraints behind the sidewalk.</li>
<li>Layout enables area between the two curb ramps to retain most of the curb height, which assists in drainage and discourages vehicles cutting across the corner.</li>
<li>Curb ramps in line with sidewalk and crosswalks, and edge of landscaping aligned with direction of travel on the crosswalk provide excellent direction cues to pedestrians who are blind or visually impaired.</li>
<li>Care must be taken to keep APS push buttons at the edge of the parkway and close enough to the landing so they are within the reach range.</li>
<li>In this example, closeness of the APS to each other will require the use of speech walk messages and additional features to clarify walk indication. If curb ramps are moved further from the corner apex, so the APS are more than 10 feet apart, speech walk messages and additional features will not be necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Example 8—Perpendicular Curb Ramps </em></p>
<blockquote>

<p class="smalltext">Perpendicular Curb Ramp—8-foot parkway with 5-foot sidewalk on curve</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>8-foot grass area or furnishing zone between curb and PAR allows adequate room for directional perpendicular curb ramps.</li>
<li>Layout enables area between the two curb ramps to retain the curb height, which assists in drainage and discourages vehicles cutting across the corner.</li>
<li>Curb ramp slope in line with sidewalk and crosswalks, and edge of landscaping aligned with crosswalk provides excellent directional cues to pedestrians who are blind or visually impaired.</li>
<li>The use of directional curb ramps will allow pedestrians with disabilities to be aligned with the crossing while waiting to cross the street and when entering the street.</li>
<li>Paired curb ramps will help meet the separation requirements for APS.</li>
<li>In this example, the APS pair are closer than 10 feet, thus requiring the use of speech walk messages and additional features to clarify walk indication. If landing area is enlarged and ramps are moved to the outside edge of the crosswalks, this may not be necessary.</li>
<li>APS push button locator tones will assist blind or visually impaired persons in finding crossing location and tactile arrows may provide some assistance with aligning to cross.</li>
</ul>

The use of parallel curb ramps will assist the designer to construct curb ramps where the intersecting streets have considerable grade differences.</li>
<li>Layout enables area between the two curb ramps to retain curb height, which assists in drainage and discourages vehicles cutting across the corner.</li>
<li>The use of a parallel curb ramp will require that the sidewalk to be raised/lowered to the landing. This will cause the pedestrians using the sidewalk system to go up and down several times when going through the area of the two curb ramps.</li>
<li>Layout moves the crosswalk closer to the intersection.</li>
<li>Ramps that do not align with the direction of travel on the crosswalk direct visually impaired and blind pedestrians toward the center of the intersection and wheelchair users have to make a directional adjustment in the roadway.</li>
<li>Paired curb ramps will help meet the separation requirements for APS.</li>
<li>Care must be taken to keep APS push buttons close enough to the landing and edge of landscaping so they are within the reach range.</li>

<ul>
<li>8-foot grass area or furnishing zone between curb and PAR allows for perpendicular curb ramps.</li>
<li>Crosswalk is a greater distance from intersection, but crosswalk distance is shorter due to location away from apex.</li>
<li>Layout enables area between the two curb ramps to retain curb height, which assists in drainage and discourages vehicles cutting across the corner.</li>
<li>Curb ramp slope in line with sidewalk and crosswalks and edge of landscaping aligned with crosswalk provides excellent direction cues to pedestrians who are blind or visually impaired.</li>
<li>Paired curb ramps will help meet the more than 10 foot separation requirements for APS.</li>
<li>APS push button locator tone will assist blind or visually impaired persons in finding crossing location and tactile arrow may provide some assistance with aligning to cross.</li>
