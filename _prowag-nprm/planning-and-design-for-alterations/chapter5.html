<p><strong>Introduction </strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this section is to illustrate the basic elements comprising the public right-of-way and look at the sidewalk environment as a whole. To effectively design and/or alter the public right-of-way, the components must be analyzed in relationship to each other. The inter-relationships of existing slopes and objects, vehicular demands, timing requirements, and pedestrian needs can create a challengingt design context.</p>

<p>In many jurisdictions, the right-of-way is divided into four zones: the frontage zone, the pedestrian zone, the furnishing zone, and the curb zone. The frontage zone is the strip along the inside (non-vehicular) edge and is frequently the location for signage, building-related construction (e.g. ramps, walls, and entries) and other pedestrian amenities. The pedestrian zone includes the PAR as described below. The furnishing zone is adjacent to the curb line and is the location most frequently used for bus stops, parking meters, utility connections, light poles, and similar appurtenances. The curb zone is literally the top of the curb.</p>
<p>Understanding the terminology and the requirements that relate to each of the major components of the pedestrian environment is the first step toward development of a successful design system that addresses the public right-of-way as a whole. The components that are illustrated in this chapter include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public right-of-way: land or property, usually in a corridor, that is acquired for or devoted to transportation purposes.</li>
<li>Sidewalk: that portion of a public right-of-way between the curb line or lateral line of a roadway and the adjacent property line that is improved for use by pedestrians. Total sidewalk width is the surfaced (paved) area measured from back of curb to right-of-way line.</li>
<li>Curb line: a line at the face of the curb that marks the transition between the sidewalk and gutter or roadway.</li>
<li>PAR: an accessible corridor for pedestrian use within the pedestrian zone of the public right-of-way. The PAR is the path that provides continuous connection from the public right-of-way to building or property entry points, parking areas, public transportation, and/or other destinations. This route should be firm, stable, and slip-resistant and should comply with maximum cross slope requirements. All transitions (e.g. from street to ramp, ramp to landing) must be flush and free of changes in level. The PAR should be at least four feet wide, although five feet is preferred since it provides adequate space for two pedestrians to pass and space for two pedestrians traveling in the same direction to walk side-by-side. A five-foot PAR width eliminates the need to provide passing areas at 200-foot intervals and is a more comfortable walking environment. For many users, a path of reduced vibration significantly increases the accessibility of the environment. Decorative pavers, beveled edges, and other surface treatments can create a painfully bumpy surface and are best used at edges. The PAR should also be free of obstacles and protrusions.</li>
<li>Detectable warnings: a surface feature built in or applied to walking surfaces or other elements to warn of hazards on a circulation path. The warning feature should be six inches back from the curb line, at least 24 inches deep and extend over the entire side-to-side surface of the ramp or blended transition. The pattern and spacing of the detectable warning surface is described in section R304 of the Draft PROWAG. The detectable warning surface must be in visual contrast to the surrounding ramp surfaces.</li>
<li>
<div align="center">Curb ramps: short ramps cutting through a curb or built up to it. The locations and shapes of the ramped surfaces define the types that are generally used. Ramp edges may be either flared or returned, although if edge returns are used, the adjacent surface should not be a pedestrian circulation path. Ramps have four-foot by four-foot landings at top and bottom, although five-foot by five-foot is preferable. Ramp flares can not be considered part of the PAR. <img src="/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/parallel.gif" alt="Sketch of parallel curb ramp" width="400" height="232"></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="smalltext" align="center">Parallel curb ramps have the running slope parallel to the curb line.</p>

<p class="smalltext" align="center">Perpendicular curb ramps have the running slope perpendicular to the curb line.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p class="smalltext">Blended transitions are situations where either the entire sidewalk has been brought down to the street or crosswalk level or the street has been brought up to the sidewalk level.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Combinations of these types of ramps can be used effectively. For additional examples of the shapes and combinations, see Chapter 6, Curb Ramp Examples. The models that are presented in this chapter begin with an illustration of a nearly ideal 15- to 20-foot-wide sidewalk section in an urban area. The width of the right-of-way permits easy development of a five-foot-wide PAR with plenty of area left for bus stops, outdoor furnishings, tree areas, accessible parking, utility poles, hydrants, and other elements. The width of the PAR is constrained in each succeeding model illustrating typical relationships of the same elements in 12-foot, 8-foot, and 4- to 5-foot-wide pedestrian zone conditions. All sidewalks are measured from the back of the curb to the edge of the right-of-way. These illustrations are not intended to be an exhaustive analysis of all possible solutions to the problem posed by narrow right-of-way conditions, but rather to begin the process of suggesting</p>
<p>alternates and methods for prioritizing improvements.</p>
<p>Case Study—Wayfinding at Roundabouts</p>
<ul>
<li>In this conversion to a roundabout, landscaping separates and delineates the pedestrian route, providing guidance to the crosswalk location for pedestrians who are visually impaired.</li>
<li>Detectable warnings are correctly installed in pairs, clearly defining the pedestrian refuge space at the splitter island.</li>
<li>Crosswalk is well-marked for contrast (although its brick surface will be high-maintenance.)</li>

<p>Case Study—Parallel Curb Ramps and Road Grade</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="/images/guidelines_standards/Streets_Sidewalks/PROW/DSCN1363_fmt.jpeg" alt="Case Study: Photo of parallel ramp at midblock crossing." align="right" border="1">The parallel curb ramp shown was placed into a sidewalk/roadway with an existing grade of approximately 4%. The design thus called for a longer uphill ramp run from the central landing than required for the downhill ramp run to achieve acceptable ramp slopes.</li>
<li>Both ramp runs slope at 8.3% maximum. On a steeper roadway, it may be necessary to limit the longer ramp run to avoid ‘chasing grade' indefinitely. PROWAAC suggests 15 feet as a practical limit.</li>
<li>Still needed: detectable warnings</li>

Keep signage from protruding into clear approach areas and/or PAR.</li>
