shall not be prohibited beneath an element but shall not be considered
as part of the clear space.

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R405.1 General.** Clearances are measured in relation to the usable clear space, not necessarily to the vertical support for an element. When determining clearance under an object, care should be taken to ensure that the space is clear of any obstructions.

#### R405.2 Toe Clearance

#### R409.8 Surfaces
Handrail gripping surfaces and any surfaces
adjacent to them shall be free of sharp or abrasive elements and shall
have rounded edges.

beyond and in the same direction of ramp runs and stair flights in
accordance with R409.10. Extensions shall not be required for continuous
handrails at the inside turn of switchback or dogleg ramps and

clear width required for pedestrian access routes, handrail extensions
shall not be required.

##### R409.10.1 Top and Bottom Extension at Ramps
Ramp handrails shall
extend horizontally above the landing for 305 mm (1.0 ft) minimum beyond
the top and bottom of ramp runs. Extensions shall return to a wall,

#### R410.2 Finish and Contrast
Characters and their background shall
have a non-glare finish. Characters shall contrast with their background
with either light characters on a dark background or dark characters on
a light background.

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R410.2.1 Finish and Contrast.** Signs are more legible for pedestrians with low vision when characters contrast as much as possible with their background. Additional factors affecting the ease with which the text can be distinguished from its background include shadows cast by lighting sources, surface glare, and the uniformity of the text and its background colors and textures.

#### R410.3 Case

Minimum character height shall comply with
Table R410.6. Viewing distance shall be measured as the horizontal
distance between the character and an obstruction preventing further
approach towards the sign. Character height shall be based on the
