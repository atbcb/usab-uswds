The inability to use one’s wheelchair on airplanes makes air travel very difficult, if not impossible, for many people with disabilities. Among other challenges, it requires multiple transfers between boarding chairs and aircraft seats, posing injury risks. To address these challenges, the U.S. Access Board commissioned a study to assess the feasibility of equipping aircraft with securement systems so that passengers can remain in their wheelchairs on flights. The Transportation Research Board (TRB), of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, will release its [final report](({{ site.baseurl }}/files/research/trb-final-report-sept2021.pdf) mid-September. The U.S. Access Board will host a public briefing on the final report on **September 22** from **1:00 – 3:00 pm (ET)**. The briefing will feature a presentation by the TRB Study Committee Members, including Committee Chair Dr. Alan M. Jette, on the two-year research study that focused on the design, engineering, and safety requirements for equipping aircraft with securement systems for wheelchairs. The event is free, but registration is required. Members of the public will be able to pose questions during the event. 

For further information on registration, visit the [Access Board’s website]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/meetings.html) or contact Rose Marie Bunales at [events@access-board.gov](mailto:events@access-board.gov). Note that the briefing will include video remote interpreting (VRI) and real-time captioning.
