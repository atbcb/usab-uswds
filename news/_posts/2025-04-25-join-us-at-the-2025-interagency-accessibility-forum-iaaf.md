This year’s annual Interagency Accessibility Forum (IAAF) will be held virtually on May 20 and 21. The event will be built on the theme **Accessible by Design: Enhancing Efficiency in Federal ICT** and will take place over Zoom for Government. IAAF will feature a blend of presentations, workshops, and discussions led by accessibility professionals in the federal, private, and other sectors. Presentation topics include best practices in managing and implementing digital accessibility imperatives including Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.

IAAF is hosted by the Government-wide IT Accessibility Program within the Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP) at the [General Services Administration (GSA)](https://www.gsa.gov/), and co-sponsored by the U.S. Access Board in collaboration with other federal agencies.

The Access Board will be participating in several sessions, for details, see the most updated agenda on [www.section508.gov/iaaf](https://www.section508.gov/iaaf/). 

IAAF provides a venue for federal accessibility professionals, buyers, developers, designers, project managers, leadership, and many others to exchange best practices in managing and implementing digital accessibility standards and reporting required by [Section 508](https://www.access-board.gov/about/law/ra.html#section-508-federal-electronic-and-information-technology) of the Rehabilitation Act.
