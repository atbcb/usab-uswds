With great sadness, the U.S. Access Board mourns the passing of former President James Earl “Jimmy” Carter Jr., who served as the 39th President of the United States from 1977 to 1981. A native Georgian, President Carter began his public career in the Georgia State Senate, where he served for two terms from 1963 to 1967. He would later go on to be elected the 76th Governor of Georgia, where he served from 1971 to 1975.

President Carter passed away on December 29, 2024, at the age of 100 years old. Regarding his passing, Board Executive Director Sachin Pavithran remarked, “President Carter’s legacy continues to have a profound impact on the Access Board to this day. His signing of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments expanded the role of the agency and paved the way for future rulemaking meant to advance access for all Americans. The Access Board mourns President Carter’s passing but celebrates his inspiring life of service to the United States.”

During the Carter Administration, [the Rehabilitation Act](https://www.access-board.gov/about/law/ra.html), which created the Access Board, was amended to expand the Board’s mandate. Signed into law by President Carter, [the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1978](https://www.access-board.gov/about/history.html) authorized the Access Board to establish design guidelines under the [Architectural Barriers Act (ABA)](https://www.access-board.gov/aba/) to establish a minimum level of accessibility. The Access Board’s technical assistance role was expanded to include providing help on the [removal of barriers](https://www.access-board.gov/enforcement/) as well as communication barriers in federally funded buildings and facilities. In addition, the Access Board was directed to provide [technical assistance](https://www.access-board.gov/ta/) to private entities.

Additionally, under the Rehabilitation Act Amendments, Public Members appointed by the President were to join the representatives from federal departments on the agency’s Governing Board. President Carter appointed the Board’s [first eleven Public Members](https://www.access-board.gov/about/members-past.html) in 1979.

The Access Board remembers the lifetime of service that President Jimmy Carter gave to his country, and sends its condolences to his sons, daughter, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, and to his many friends and colleagues.
