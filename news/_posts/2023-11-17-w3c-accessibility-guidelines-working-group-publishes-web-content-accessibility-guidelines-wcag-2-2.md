The [Accessibility Guidelines Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/ag/) (AG WG) recently published [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/REC-WCAG22-20231005/) as a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Recommendation. WCAG 2.2 adds nine new requirements to WCAG 2.1 and provides supporting documents to explain how to make web content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including people with visual, mobility, hearing, and cognitive disabilities. The [new requirements/Success Criteria in WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/) address ways to help users navigate and find content, operate functionality more easily through various inputs beyond keyboard, develop webpages to appear and operate in predictable ways, and readily avoid and correct mistakes. Additionally, WCAG 2.2 includes [personas](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/#about-the-personas) to help explain some aspects of the WCAG Success Criteria. 

The mission of the AG WG is to develop specifications to make content on the web accessible to people with disabilities and to participate in the development and maintenance of implementation support materials for the WCAG. The U.S. Access Board has participated in the AG WG to develop WCAG 2.0 and all subsequent WCAG versions and continues to assist with supporting materials and test rules for the accessibility criteria. Board Accessibility Specialists provide their input and feedback to ensure websites and web content are accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities.  

Additionally, the Board’s [Revised Section 508 Standards](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/) incorporate WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria to ensure information and communication technology (ICT) developed, procured, maintained, or used by federal agencies is accessible to people with physical, sensory, or cognitive disabilities. Examples include computers, telecommunications equipment, multifunction office machines such as copiers that also operate as printers, software, websites, information kiosks and transaction machines, and electronic documents. 

Under Section 508, the Board is also responsible for providing technical assistance on the standards. Subject matter experts are available by email at [508@access-board.gov](mailto:508@access-board.gov) for questions, and the Board also offers free [Section 508 Best Practices webinars](https://www.access-board.gov/webinars/), [virtual and in-person training](https://www.access-board.gov/webinars/training.html), and, in close collaboration with the General Services Administration, materials and resources that are available at [Section508.gov](https://www.section508.gov/).
