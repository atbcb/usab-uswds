As part of the Developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) Equity, Access & Inclusion for All Series, the Access Board is holding public hearings with members of the disability community, Federal Agency AI leaders, and AI practitioners. This series stems from the Board’s [Memorandum of Understanding](https://www.access-board.gov/news/2024/05/15/u-s-access-board-holds-signing-of-artificial-intelligence-memorandum-of-understanding-with-disability-and-technology-partners/) with the [American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD)](https://www.aapd.com/) and the [Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT)](https://cdt.org/). In total, three virtual hearing sessions will take place: two for the disability community (on August 8) and one for federal agency and AI industry practitioners (on August 22).

The hearings support the Access Board’s work in fulfilling the [Executive Order on the Use of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/) to engage with disability community members and AI practitioners to learn about the risks and benefits of AI, and to issue recommendations and technical assistance to promote equity, accessibility, and inclusion for all.
