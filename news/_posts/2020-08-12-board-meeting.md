All are welcome to attend the next bimonthly meeting of the U.S. Access Board, which will be open to the public and take place virtually on September 16 from 1:00 to 3:00 (ET).  The agenda includes brief reports from Board committees and the Interim Executive Director and features presentations on the work of the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR), the federal government’s primary disability research agency. 

Representatives from NIDILRR will provide an overview of programs and grant projects on research to advance accessibility and technology for people with disabilities.  Presenters include Dr. Phil Beatty and Dr. Sarah Ruiz of the NIDILRR Office of Research Sciences who will discuss NIDILRRs programs and research centers, including the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Centers (RERCs) that conduct advanced engineering research and develop innovative technologies to advance accessibility and remove environmental barriers. 

They will be joined by researchers from several RERCs.  Dr. Jordana Maisel of the University at Buffalo will provide a briefing on the work of the RERC on Physical Access and Transportation and the RERC on Universal Design and the Built Environment.  Dr. Janice C. Light of Pennsylvania State University will review research undertaken by the RERC on Augmentative and Alternative Communication.
