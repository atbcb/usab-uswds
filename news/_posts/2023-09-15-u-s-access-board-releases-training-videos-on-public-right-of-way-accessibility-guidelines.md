The U.S. Access Board continues to provide resources and training on the recently published [final rule on public right-of-way accessibility guidelines](https://www.access-board.gov/prowag/) by releasing five new videos on the [Board’s YouTube Channel.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5tRWTtV5eSw68N3tSpmyWw) These videos supplement the Board’s free technical assistance on the guidelines via email at [row@access-board.gov](mailto:row@access-board.gov) and [accessibility training by request](https://www.access-board.gov/webinars/training.html) at [training@access-board.gov](mailto:training@access-board.gov) 

The first four videos offer a chapter-by-chapter review of the guidelines to better understand the accessibility requirements to make sidewalks, crosswalks, shared use paths, on-street parking, and other pedestrian facilities accessible to people with disabilities. The fifth video, “What’s New in the Final Rule Text,” highlights changes in the final rule for members of the public who are familiar with the [proposed accessibility guidelines published in 2013](https://www.access-board.gov/prowag/proposed/), including the previously referenced sections of the [Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (MUTCD)](https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/). The Board also posted a list of significant changes to the final rule from the version proposed in the September 1 news article “[Notable Changes in Public Right-of-Way Accessibility Guidelines Final Rule.](https://www.access-board.gov/news/2023/09/01/notable-changes-in-public-right-of-way-accessibility-guidelines-final-rule/).”
