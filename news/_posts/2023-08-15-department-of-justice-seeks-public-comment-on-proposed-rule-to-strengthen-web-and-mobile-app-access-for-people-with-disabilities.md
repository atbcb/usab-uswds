The Department of Justice (DOJ) has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that aims to improve web and mobile applications (apps) access for people with disabilities and clarify how public entities, primarily state and local governments, can meet their existing ADA obligations as many of their activities shift online.  The public can submit comments through **October 3, 2023**. 

Across the U.S., people routinely rely on web and mobile apps to access a variety of vital public programs and services, such as employment and educational resources, voting information, health and emergency services, parking, and transit schedules. The proposed rule is particularly significant in the wake of the pandemic, as public entities have significantly increased the scope of essential services and programs offered through the web and mobile apps. It is critical for these technologies to be accessible for people with disabilities.  

DOJ invites written comments and input from the public and relevant stakeholders on the regulatory proposal via any of the following methods:   

* [Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-15823): Select the “Submit a Formal Comment” link at the top of the notice and follow the instructions.    
* [Regulations.gov e-rulemaking portal](https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOJ-CRT-2023-0007-0001/): Select “Comment” link and follow the instructions.
