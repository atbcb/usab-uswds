The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the General Services Administration (GSA) have submitted [Section 508 Report to the President and Congress: Accessibility of Federal Electronic and Information Technology to Congress and the President](https://www.justice.gov/crt/page/file/1569331/download). Based on data from February 2021 through August 2022, the report presents the degree to which some federal agencies are making progress on compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.  

Section 508 requires federal agencies to ensure that the information and communication technology (ICT) they develop, procure, maintain, or use is accessible and useable by people with disabilities, including both federal employees and members of the public. Examples of ICT include computers, websites, video, phone systems, electronic documents, and multifunction office machines, such copiers, printers, and information kiosks and transaction machines. 

The U.S. Access Board is responsible for developing ICT accessibility standards, which are [incorporated into the Federal Acquisition Regulation](https://www.section508.gov/blog/far-update-adds-revised-508-standards/), and providing technical assistance (TA) on Section 508, including its implications beyond the federal government. The Board offers TA through email at [508@access-board.gov](mailto:508@access-board.gov) and provides [we](https://www.access-board.gov/webinars/)binars and specialized [trainings](https://www.access-board.gov/webinars/training.html). In addition, the Board works closely with GSA in posting extensive guidance and accessibility materials to the [www.Section508.gov](http://www.section508.gov/) website.
