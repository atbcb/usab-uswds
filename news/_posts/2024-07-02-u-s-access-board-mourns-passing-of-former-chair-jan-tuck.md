With great sadness, the U.S. Access Board mourns the passing of former Board Member and longtime disability advocate, Jan Tuck. Appointed by President George W. Bush in 2002, Tuck served as Chair of the Board twice during her term. Her remarkable legacy of disability advocacy was evident in her service on the [Passenger Vessels Access Advisory Committee](https://www.access-board.gov/advisory-committee-reports/passenger-vessels/pvaac-report-intro/), where she led efforts for accessible guidance and inclusive design for passenger vessels. These efforts helped contribute to the Board’s [proposed Passenger Vessels Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.access-board.gov/pvag/) under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). 

Tuck also served in several capacities with the International Council of Cruise Lines, the Society for Accessible Travel & Hospitality (SATH), and the American Society of Travel Advisors Committee for Travelers with Disabilities. Since 1999, she served as Manager of Access Compliance for Princess Cruises. 

Tuck passed away on June 27, 2024. Regarding her passing, Board Executive Director Sachin Pavithran remarked, “Jan’s legacy continues to have a profound impact on the Access Board to this day. Her work toward greater accessibility for passenger vessels and travelers has had an incredible effect on our rulemaking efforts. The Access Board mourns Jan’s passing but celebrates her inspiring life of service to the disability community and to the United States.” 

The Access Board remembers the lifetime of service that Jan Tuck gave to the disability community and sends its condolences to her family, friends, and colleagues.
