The U.S. Access Board has redesigned and updated its website at [www.access-board.gov](http://www.access-board.gov/). The new site features a streamlined design to make information easier to find. New menus and cross links enhance navigation of key resources, including the [ADA Accessibility Standards](https://www.access-board.gov/ada/) and the [Section 508 Standards](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/). In addition, the site updates information on Board programs and services, including training and filing of complaints under the ABA.

The Board updated its site based on the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov) (USWDS). Developed by the General Services Administration (GSA) and U.S. Digital Service, the USWDS helps federal agencies create websites that are accessible, fast, and easy to use on mobile devices. The 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act requires agencies to aims to update their websites using the USWDS to improve the digital experience for government customers.

Now published on GSA’s [Federalist platform](https://federalist.18f.gov), the Board’s website continues to serve as a leading resource on accessible design and federal accessibility guidelines and standards. Through this site, the Board provides updates to the public on initiatives in rulemaking, research, ABA enforcement, and other programs. The Board’s guidelines and standards, published guidance, animations, and other resources are also available on the site.

Send questions or comments on the site to <webmaster@access-board.gov>.
