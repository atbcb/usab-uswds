Touchscreen kiosks and other types of self-service transaction machines (SSTMs) are a common feature in places of public accommodation, government offices, and other buildings and facilities, allowing users to independently conduct a range of transactions and functions. The U.S. Access Board has issued an [advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/21/2022-20470/americans-with-disabilities-act-accessibility-guidelines-for-buildings-and-facilities-architectural) on supplemental accessibility guidelines for different types of SSTMs, including electronic self-service kiosks, for persons with disabilities. The Board seeks comments on accessibility related to the various types of SSTMs, use and design of SSTMs, location of SSTMs, and economic impacts on small business, non-profit, and governmental entities in the implementation of accessible SSTMs.  

SSTMs and kiosks typically have touchscreen interfaces with on-screen buttons or a keyboard. Without a physical keypad or other tactile controls, these machines are unusable by many people who are blind or have low vision if information is not provided audibly. They also frequently lack captioning and text equivalents for audible information, posing barriers for users who are deaf or hard of hearing. Additionally, automated teller machines (ATMs) and fare machines must be accessible for people who use mobility devices by enabling them to access the front of the machine, use the controls and keys, and view the display screen from a seated position and with privacy. 

The notice is based on technical requirements for ATMs and fare machines in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) Accessibility Standards and relevant provisions for hardware in the revised standards applicable to information and communication technology subject to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (Revised 508 Standards). The ADA and ABA Accessibility Standards require ATMs and fare vending machines be accessible to people who have mobility disabilities, limited dexterity, or are of short stature by addressing clear floor space, reach range, operable parts, privacy, speech output, braille, and display screens. The Board is also considering incorporating certain requirements in the Revised 508 Standards for “closed” hardware into a proposed rule. An [SSTM Comparison Matrix](https://downloads.regulations.gov/ATBCB-2022-0004-0002/attachment_1.docx) of the ADA and ABA Guidelines, the Revised 508 Standards, and the Department of Transportation’s rule on airport kiosks is available in the rulemaking docket.  

Public comments for the ANPRM are due by November 21, 2022. Individuals may submit comments via any of the following methods:
