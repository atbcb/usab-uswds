Under Executive Order on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) in the Federal Workforce ([14035](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/06/30/2021-14127/diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce)), federal agencies must ensure that their workplaces are fully accessible to all employees, including those with disabilities. To assist agencies in promoting and enhancing accessibility in their DEIA Strategic Plans, the Board has developed a set of recommendations and resources, which is available on its DEIA webpage. The recommendations and resources include information for employees to file an Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) complaint if they experience barriers in accessing federal facilities, tips on workplace accessibility practices, and links to accessibility guides, upcoming and archived webinars, and technical assistance contact information. Information on resources about Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act for ensuring access to information and communication technology, such as computer hardware and software and agency websites, are also provided.
