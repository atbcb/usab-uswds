Over the three days, agency practitioners will provide presentations, skill-builder sessions, and panel discussions on various topics, including reasonable accommodations, equity and civil rights for people with disabilities, accessibility in strategic plans and mission priorities, best practices for accessibility in built and digital workplaces, and strategic recruitment, hiring, and retention. 

At the Summit, Board Executive Director Sachin Pavithran will present and moderate the panel “The Transition to Sustainable Digital Accessibility.” Alison Levy, Director of Office of Technical and Information Services at the Board, will also provide a keynote and be a moderator for the panel “Future of Work: Building a Culture of Accessibility.”  Additionally, Board Senior Accessibility Specialists Bill Botten and Kathy Eng will present on accessibility in the federal workplace for built and digital environments, respectively.
