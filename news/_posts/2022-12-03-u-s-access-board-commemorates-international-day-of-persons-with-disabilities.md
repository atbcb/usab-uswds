The U.S. Access Board commemorates the International Day of Persons with Disabilities (IDPD), as observed on December 3. The annual observance of IDPD was proclaimed in 1992 by the United Nations General Assembly resolution 47/3. IDPD aims to promote an understanding of disability issues and mobilize support for the dignity, rights, and well-being of people with disabilities.  

The Board regularly works with organizations and representatives at the international level to discuss the [Americans with Disabilities (ADA)](https://www.access-board.gov/ada/) and [Architectural Barriers Act (ABA)](https://www.access-board.gov/aba/) guidelines and standards and promote and provide education on accessible design and accessibility. In 2022, Board leadership and other staff met with representatives and advisors from European Parliament, European Standard (EN) 301 549 Working Group, Shared Services Canada, Poland’s Government Plenipotentiary for Disabled People, and Kyrgyzstan as part of a “Disability Rights” exchange project under the U.S. Department of State’s International Visitor Leadership Program, to name a few. These meetings focused on a variety of topics, from providing information and training on disability laws in the U.S. to collaborating on identification and problem-solving of barriers in digital online accessibility throughout government. 

The Board looks forward to continuing to work with international partners and celebrating the recognition of people with disabilities around the globe every day.
