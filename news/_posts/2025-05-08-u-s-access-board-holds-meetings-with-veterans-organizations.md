On Monday, April 28, following a series of meetings at the Access Board’s office in Washington, DC, Board Members and staff walked to the [World War I Memorial](https://www.nps.gov/wwim/index.htm) on Pennsylvania Avenue, which is managed by the [National Park Service (NPS)](https://www.nps.gov/index.htm). Park staff lead Access Board Members on a tour of the accessibility features of the memorial, including tactile maps, newly-installed ramps, sloped design elements, and NPS mobile app features among others.

These accessibility features provide visitors with disabilities the opportunity to experience the full emotional breadth of the memorial. From the Belvedere, the conceptual center of the memorial, visitors can view Sabin Howard’s sculpture *A Soldier’s Journey*, the John J. Pershing Memorial, and the flagstaff with a quote from President Woodrow Wilson. Throughout the memorial, visitors can also find quotes by Librarian of Congress and WWI veteran Archibald MacLeish, author Willa Cather, and Alta May Andrews of the Army Nurse Corps.

The memorial honors all Americans who served in the Great War, including the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF), U.S. Navy sailors, Coast Guardsmen, uniformed servicemembers who did not serve in Europe, and Americans who served in civilian roles. Following its tour of the accessibility features, the Board was honored to attend the [Doughboy Foundation’s](https://doughboy.org/) Daily Taps Ceremony, which occurs at the World War I Memorial every day at 5:00 pm (ET).

Later, on Tuesday, April 29, the Access Board attended a series of meetings with [Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA)](https://pva.org/) in Washington, DC. PVA is a Congressionally chartered veterans service organization that focuses on veterans of the armed forces who have experienced spinal cord injury or dysfunction. The organization advocates on behalf of its members for quality health care, veterans benefits, and civil rights and opportunities that maximize the independence of members. PVA also advocates for research and education addressing spinal cord injury and dysfunction.

Access Board Members had the opportunity to observe the new national headquarters of PVA on I Street. The new office space includes expanded restrooms with lowered switch entrances and showers, accessible height counters and common areas with amenities, kitchen appliances with adaptive features, working areas equipped with adjustable height desks, widened pathways, and many other accessibility features. Following this observation, the Board met with PVA leadership, including CEO Carl Blake, to discuss the mission and goals of the organization.

Following its sessions with PVA, the Board met with Collie Turner, who is the Founder and Executive Director of [Heroic Gardens](https://heroicgardens.org/), a nonprofit organization serving veterans with disabilities through adaptive gardening. Turner provided Board Members with a demonstration of one of the organization’s programs, which involved therapeutic horticulture and teambuilding activities. Heroic Gardens has received a commendation from the [Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)](https://www.va.gov/) through its [National Community Partnership Challenge (CPC)](https://www.va.gov/HEALTHPARTNERSHIPS/cpc/index.asp).
