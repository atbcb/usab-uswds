The U.S. Access Board has published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) asking for public comment on its approach to developing technical standards for universal changing stations required to be provided by sponsors of medium and large hub airports seeking airport development project grants. The [FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024](https://www.faa.gov/about/reauthorization) requires the Access Board to issue these standards, and the ANPRM proposes multiple approaches to developing them.

A universal changing table (also known as an “adult changing table”) is a table on which an individual with a disability receives assistance from a caregiver with toileting. They are used by individuals with a range of disabilities and medical conditions, who may be wheelchair users, older adults, or children, teens, or adults with developmental disabilities, among others.

The Board requests general information and comments on whether to incorporate by reference an existing industry standard or develop a new standard, elements that should be included within the room where a universal changing table is located, and associated costs. To view the ANPRM, staff contact information, or instructions on providing comments, go to the [docket webpage](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2026/02/18/2026-03199/accessibility-standards-for-universal-changing-stations).
