The U.S. Access Board has released technical bulletins on accessibility to lavatories and sinks, washing machines and clothes dryers, and saunas and steam rooms. This material addresses specifications for clear floor space, knee and toe space, forward and side reach, operable parts, height, turning space, benches, and doors in the ADA and ABA Accessibility Standards. Each bulletin clarifies common sources of confusion, answers frequently asked questions, and offers recommendations for best practice. Examples of compliant lavatories, sinks, washing machines, clothes dryers, saunas, and steam rooms are included to illustrate how various requirements can be met.

* Lavatories and Sinks ([ADA](https://www.access-board.gov/ada/guides/chapter-6-lavs-sinks/); [ABA](https://www.access-board.gov/aba/guides/chapter-6-lavs-sinks/)) 
* Washing Machines and Clothes Dryers ([ADA](https://www.access-board.gov/ada/guides/chapter-6-washers/); [ABA](https://www.access-board.gov/aba/guides/chapter-6-washers/)) 
* Saunas and Steam Rooms ([ADA](https://www.access-board.gov/ada/guides/chapter-6-saunas/); [ABA](https://www.access-board.gov/aba/guides/chapter-6-saunas/)) 

These technical bulletins are the latest installment to the Board’s online guide to the ADA and ABA Standards, which currently covers the first six chapters of the Standards. The Board also provided a webinar covering the new technical bulletins on October 7. The [webinar presentation materials](https://www.accessibilityonline.org/ao/archives/110952) are available in the archive. The Board previously issued bulletins on other plumbing elements and facilities covered in the Standards (Chapter 6), including drinking fountains, toilet rooms, and bathing facilities.   

The [Guide to the ADA Standards](https://www.access-board.gov/ada/guides/) addresses design requirements for places of public accommodation, commercial facilities, and state and local government facilities subject to the ADA. The [Guide to the ABA Standards](https://www.access-board.gov/aba/guides/) covers standards that apply to facilities that are designed, constructed, altered, or leased with federal funds. The Board’s online guide also features a series of [animations](https://www.access-board.gov/ada/guides/animations/) on different topics. 

The Board regularly provides technical guidance on its accessibility guidelines and standards and accessible design through its toll-free helpline (800-872-2253) and by email ([ta@access-board.gov](mailto:ta@access-board.gov)). Accessibility specialists are available to answer questions on accessibility as it relates to the built environment, outdoor sites, streets and sidewalks, transportation vehicles and vessels, information and communication technology, and medical diagnostic equipment.
