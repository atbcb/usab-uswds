Bill Botten, the U.S. Access Board’s Senior Accessibility Specialist and Training Coordinator, retired from federal service today. A Board employee for 22 years, Botten contributed in many ways to the mission and vision of the agency, from co-developing the combined guidelines for the [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.access-board.gov/ada/) and the [Architectural Barriers Act (ABA)](https://www.access-board.gov/aba/) Accessibility Guidelines to leading the publication of accessibility guidelines for federal outdoor developed areas to providing technical assistance on accessible design. In 2018, he was named Training Coordinator and Technical Assistance Coordinator. 

Botten, an Exercise Physiology graduate from the University of Kansas, joined the Access Board in May of 2000. Botten was always an advocate for accessibility and inclusion of people with disabilities, especially in recreational and outdoor environments. He helped advance accessibility in these unique facilities and other built environments through his hundreds of trainings and presentations to local, state, and national audiences. 

The Board commends Botten for his years of dedicated federal service and for his long-time commitment to equality and accessibility for people with disabilities.
