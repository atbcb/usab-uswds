The Joint Office of Energy and Transportation hosted the webinar [“Designing for Accessible EV Charging Stations,”](https://driveelectric.gov/webinars/accessibility) and the recording is publicly available. The webinar included a presentation by U.S. Access Board Transportation Systems Engineer Juliet Shoultz who discussed design recommendations for accessible electric vehicle (EV) charging stations.  

Shoultz reviewed applicable [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.access-board.gov/ada/), [Architectural Barriers Act (ABA)](https://www.access-board.gov/aba/), and [Section 508 ](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/)requirements and new recommendations for making EV charging stations accessible as promulgated in the Board’s technical assistance document [Design Recommendations for Accessible Electric Vehicle Charging Stations](https://www.access-board.gov/tad/ev/). This technical assistance provides guidance to those involved in the planning, designing, building, installing, and use of EV charging stations, including State and local governments, designers and developers, electrical and construction professionals, equipment manufacturers, automakers, utility providers, charge point operators and e-mobility service providers, EV owners, and people with disabilities.
