The U.S. Access Board has released a [summary report](https://www.access-board.gov/av/report.html) on its four-part series of virtual meetings on making autonomous vehicles (AVs) accessible to passengers with disabilities. The sessions featured presentations by invited speakers who shared information and research results on design considerations and solutions for making AVs accessible to passengers with mobility, sensory, or cognitive disabilities. They also provided an opportunity for members of the public to pose questions and to share information and ideas during the session or through an online discussion platform. 

The report summarizes each speakers’ presentation in the forum and comments from the public, included those posted on the online platform. In addition to the report, recordings of each session, presentation materials, and other resources are available on the [Board's website](https://www.access-board.gov/av/).
