U.S. Access Board Executive Director Sachin Pavithran will deliver a keynote on perspectives on digital inclusion as related to President’s Biden Executive Order on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) in the Federal Workforce at the M-Enabling Summit 2021 on **October 4 from 2:00 – 2:30 (ET)**. President Biden’s Executive Order requires the Board to coordinate with other agencies to support the federal government’s effort to ensure that agencies comply with applicable laws related to disability, including [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/), which requires access to information and communication technology developed, procured, maintained, or used by federal agencies, and the [Architectural Barriers Act](https://www.access-board.gov/aba/), which requires access to facilities designed, built, altered, or leased with federal funds. 

The M-Enabling Summit is a joint initiative of the Global Initiative for Inclusive Information and Communication Technologies (G3ict) and E.J. Krause & Associates (EJK) to promote accessible technologies and environments for persons with disabilities.
