General Services Administration (GSA) recently published Section 508 Program Maturity Reports (PMR) from 2019 – 2022 on [Section508.gov](https://www.section508.gov/manage/reporting/section-508-program-maturity-reports/). Federal agencies are required to report to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) twice per year on their Section 508 program maturity and effectiveness. The PMR include compliance with the [U.S. Access Board’s Section 508 Standards,](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/) development of measures for progress, and implementation of regular assessments. The PMR help to ensure the accessibility of information and communication technology (ICT) in the federal government. 

GSA’s Government-wide IT Accessibility Program analyzes the agency reporting and compiles the data to identify ways to increase collaboration across agencies, reduce redundancies, and develop solutions to improve the management of government accessibility programs. Executive summary reports, along with a companion supplemental report, are provided to OMB, the Board, and Chief Information Officers Council Accessibility Community of Practice. 

The Board provides free technical assistance on accessible ICT at [508@access-board.gov](mailto:508@access-board.gov). The Board also provides [Section 508 resources](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#additional-resources) and a [Section 508 Webinar Series,](<http://www.accessibilityonline.org/cioc-508/schedule/)>) which includes [archived Section 508 webinars](https://www.accessibilityonline.org/cioc-508/archives/).
