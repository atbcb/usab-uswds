On December 6, 2024, President Joe Biden appointed a new member to the U.S. Access Board: Betty R. Siegel, of Virginia. Betty as a newly appointed member brings a diverse range of knowledge and experiences—spanning the arts and culture, emerging assistive technology, inclusive customer service, and disability rights.

Betty Siegel is Director of the Office of Accessibility and VSA at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. A recognized leader and expert in disability and accessibility practices within the arts and culture sectors, she has worked nationally and internationally to support the rights of individuals with disabilities of all ages and backgrounds to engage fully in theaters, museums and other public spaces.

Betty succeeds Public Board Member Greg Fehribach. Greg was first appointed by President Obama in 2016. Additionally, from 2020 to 2024, Greg served [alternating one-year terms](https://www.access-board.gov/about/board-chairs-and-vice-chairs.html) as Chair and Vice-Chair of the Access Board. Along with Greg, Public Board Member Carmen Daniels Jones is also closing out her term with the agency; President Biden appointed Carmen to the Access Board in 2023.

“I thank Greg and Carmen for their years of service and time on the Board and advancing accessibility. Their knowledge and expertise have contributed to our efforts to promote and implement accessibility and inclusion throughout all segments of society.” Board Executive Director Sachin Pavithran stated. “I also welcome and am thrilled to work with Betty as she joins the Board and helps direct the agency to fulfil its mission.”

Additionally, President Biden has reappointed [Stephanie L. Enyart](https://www.access-board.gov/about/board-members/stephanie-enyart/), of Virginia, and [Madeline Rose Ruvolo](https://www.access-board.gov/about/board-members/madeline-rose-ruvolo/), of California, to the Access Board to serve until December 3, 2028. The agency looks forward to collaborating as we welcome Betty alongside all our Board Members.

The Access Board is an independent federal agency that provides leadership in accessible design under the ADA and other laws. The Board is structured to function as a coordinating body among federal agencies and to directly represent the public, particularly people with disabilities. Twelve of the 25 members of the Governing Board are representatives from most of the federal departments. The other thirteen are comprised of members of the public appointed by the president to four-year terms.
