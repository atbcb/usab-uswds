The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) seeks public comment on potential changes to its regulation implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act for recipients of HUD federal financial assistance. Section 504 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance from HUD. [HUD’s Section 504 Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/04/25/2023-08464/nondiscrimination-on-the-basis-of-disability-updates-to-huds-section-504-regulations) acknowledges the need to align HUD’s Section 504 regulation with environmental, societal, and technological advances and emerging issues.   

As indicated in the ANPRM, HUD requests general information and comments on its Section 504 regulation relating to recipients’ obligations, including advances in accessible design, the use of websites and other technology, and auxiliary aids and services, such as assistive technologies, that have become available since HUD’s Section 504 regulation was originally published in 1988. Additionally, [HUD’s Section 504 ANPRM includes several questions](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/04/25/2023-08464/nondiscrimination-on-the-basis-of-disability-updates-to-huds-section-504-regulations#p-32) on HUD’s existing Section 504 regulation in relation to effective communication, program accessibility, updating federal accessibility standards, and enforcement.
