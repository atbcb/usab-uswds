With great sadness, the U.S. Access Board mourns the passing of former staff member and lifelong disability advocate, Dennis Cannon. Cannon served as the Transportation Accessibility Specialist for the Access board from 1981-2010. As a long-time advocate for accessible transportation, his remarkable legacy of disability advocacy was evident in his service to the Access Board. Cannon serviced on the [Passenger Vessels Access Advisory Committee](https://www.access-board.gov/advisory-committee-reports/passenger-vessels/pvaac-report-intro/), where he supported efforts for accessible guidance and inclusive design for passenger vessels. These efforts helped contribute to the Board’s [proposed Passenger Vessels Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.access-board.gov/pvag/) under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Cannon also greatly contributed to the Board’s [Public Right-of-Way Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.access-board.gov/prowag/) (PROWAG) under the ADA and the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) that address access to streets and sidewalks, crosswalks, curb ramps, pedestrian signals, on-street parking, and other components of the public right-of-way. 

Cannon’s work and advocacy was long-standing and expanded beyond the agency. Cannon had served on a number of advisory committees including the advisory panel to the California Department of Transportation; efforts from that work would support the formation of the federal ADA standards related to accessible mass transit. In 2001, Cannon was selected to provide an oral history through the [Disability Rights and Independent Living Movement Oral History Project](https://oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb2j49n5h3&brand=oac4&doc.view=entire_text) that captured his legacy and advocacy for accessible transportation that began in the 1960s. 

Cannon passed away on October 23, 2024. Regarding his passing, Board Executive Director Sachin Pavithran remarked, “Dennis’ legacy continues to have a profound impact on the Access Board and disability community to this day. His work toward greater accessibility for public-rights-of-way and accessible transportation has had an incredible effect on our rulemaking efforts. The Access Board mourns Dennis’ passing but celebrates his inspiring life of service to the disability community and to the United States.” 

The Access Board remembers the lifetime of service that Dennis Cannon gave to the disability community and sends its condolences to his family, friends, and colleagues.
