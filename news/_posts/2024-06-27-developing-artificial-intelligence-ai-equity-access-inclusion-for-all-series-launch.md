Artificial Intelligence (AI) can increase accessibility, but without appropriate efforts, it can also create barriers for people with disabilities. To address equity and accessibility, the Access Board was tasked with several actions in the Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence. The Board signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in May of 2024, with the [American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD)](https://www.aapd.com/) and the [Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT)](https://cdt.org/) to ensure that the disability community is engaged and supported through education and resources related to AI. Learn more about the MOU and our partnership [here](https://www.access-board.gov/news/2024/05/15/u-s-access-board-holds-signing-of-artificial-intelligence-memorandum-of-understanding-with-disability-and-technology-partners/). A key element of the MOU is launching an informative and collaborative AI series that will include information sessions, public hearings, and sharing best practices.
