On December 18, the Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a final rule adopting the Access Board’s [Public Right-of-Way Accessibility Guidelines (PROWAG)](https://www.access-board.gov/prowag/) as part of its Americans with Disability Act (ADA) standards for new construction and alterations of transit stops in the public right-of-way. The ADA directs the Access Board to issue technical guidelines for accessible design that serve as the basis of DOT and the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) enforceable ADA Accessibility Standards.

Once DOT’s [final rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/12/18/2024-29990/transportation-for-individuals-with-disabilities-adoption-of-accessibility-standards-for-pedestrian) becomes effective on January 17, 2025, new construction and alterations of transit stops in the public right-of-way will be required to comply with technical accessibility specifications. These include requirements for boarding and alighting areas, boarding platforms, transit shelters, and accessible connections to existing pedestrian circulation paths.

Transit stops are defined as an area that is designated for passengers to board or alight from buses, rail cars, and other transportation vehicles that operate on a fixed route or scheduled route, including bus stops and *boarding platforms.* This definition does not include intercity rail except where a stop is located in the *public right-of-way*.

The Board applauds DOT’s prompt work toward ensuring that people with disabilities have equal access to transit stops. Read more in the department’s [news release](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/dot-issues-final-rule-establishing-accessibility-standards-pedestrian-facilities). DOT is the second federal agency or department to adopt PROWAG for enforcement since the Board issued the guidelines in August 2023. The General Services Administration (GSA) [adopted PROWAG](https://www.access-board.gov/news/2024/07/08/gsa-adopts-access-board-s-public-right-of-way-accessibility-guidelines-into-enforceable-standards/) in July 2024.

The Board continues to provide resources and technical assistance related to PROWAG, including a recent webinar on [Accessible Bus and Van Transportation](https://www.access-board.gov/webinars/2024/12/05/accessible-bus-and-van-transportation/) that included guidance on the technical requirements for accessible transportation facilities as addressed in the ADA Standards and in PROWAG. Learn more about PROWAG on the Board’s [webpage](https://www.access-board.gov/prowag/). Questions related to PROWAG can be directed by email to [row@access-board.gov](mailto:row@access-board.gov) or by phone at 202-272-0080, extension 3.
