Self-driving or “autonomous” vehicles (AVs) stand to revolutionize transportation in the U.S. and around the world. It’s important that they’re designed to be inclusive of everyone. To promote accessibility for people with disabilities in the design of AVs, the U.S. Access Board is hosting “[Inclusive Design of Autonomous Vehicles: A Public Dialogue](https://transportationinnovation.ideascale.com/a/index#active-dialogues%22%20HYPERLINK%20%22https://transportationinnovation.ideascale.com/a/index#active-dialogues)” with the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Disability Employment Policy, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Community Living, and other federal agencies. 

This national online dialogue is open to the public at this time. You’re invited to share your ideas for designing AVs that are inclusive of everyone, including passengers with physical, sensory, or cognitive disabilities. The dialogue hosts want to hear from you about: 

* Design and development of AVs to ensure accessible entering, exiting, onboard maneuvering, and securement for individuals with mobility disabilities; 
* Accessible ride hailing, on-board communication, and interacting with AVs for passengers with hearing, visual or cognitive disabilities; and 
* Ideas for future research needs and next steps required to ensure accessible design and development of AVs for those with disabilities. 

Join the dialogue at any time now through May 5 to submit your ideas or to comment and vote on ideas submitted by others. Visit [TransportationInnovation.IdeaScale.com](https://transportationinnovation.ideascale.com/) to participate at your convenience. 

*Virtual Public Meetings on AVs* 

The dialogue is being held in conjunction with the Board's public series of four virtual meetings on making AVs accessible to passengers with disabilities. Visit the Board’s [AV webpage](https://www.access-board.gov/av/) for more information about the series.
