  chalkboard background overlaid with mathematical equations. In the center of
  the poster, on a diagonal, is a black rectangle bordered by small teal, yellow
  and red rectangles. It features the 2022 NDEAM theme, “Disability: Part of the
  Equity Equation,” along with an equation composed of several graphics: a
  circular photo of a woman in a wheelchair working at a computer with
  colleagues, followed by a plus sign, followed by a square image of a woman who
  uses crutches viewing a document with a colleague, followed by an equal sign,
  followed by a light bulb icon. Across the top of the rectangle in small, white
  letters are the words National Disability Employment Awareness Month. Along
  the bottom in small white letters is the hashtag “NDEAM” followed by ODEP’s
  website address, dol.gov/ODEP. In the lower right corner in white lettering is
  the DOL seal followed by the words “Office of Disability Employment Policy
  United States Department of Labor.”"
