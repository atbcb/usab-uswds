The U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has released for public comment a [proposed rule](http://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/28/2020-28648/make-inoperative-exemptions-vehicle-modifications-to-accommodate-people-with-disabilities) to improve access to motor vehicles, including rental cars, for people with disabilities. The rule proposes changes to NHTSA’s Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard to facilitate the use of adaptive equipment in rental cars and to simplify vehicle transport of wheelchairs and scooters. 

Federal law generally prohibits making a vehicle’s safety features inoperable. One proposed change would permit rental car companies to temporarily disable a driver’s air bag to install hand controls. In an accident, the deployment of the knee bolster air bag can result in the hand controls hitting and injuring the driver. A second proposed change would allow installation of rear-mounted transporters for wheelchairs and scooters. These transporters may obstruct the view of a vehicle’s backup camera. 

Public comments are due January 27, 2021.
