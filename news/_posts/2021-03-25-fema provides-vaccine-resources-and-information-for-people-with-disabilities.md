The Biden Administration has tasked the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) with managing set-up and operations for [Community Vaccination Centers](https://www.fema.gov/disasters/coronavirus/vaccine-support/vaccine-center) across the country. With other federal agencies, FEMA established a Civil Rights Advisory Group that developed a [Civil Rights Checklist](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_civil-rights-covid-19_vaccine_checklist_02-11-2021.pdf) and [Best Practice Information resource](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/fema_covid_bp_disability-considerations.pdf) to provide states, territories, and tribes a list of civil rights considerations and resources to ensure equitable vaccine access. 

“It is essential that people with disabilities have equitable vaccine access,” U.S. Access Board Executive Director Sachin Dev Pavithran remarked. “This means ensuring that strategies are developed and implemented with the integration of the needs of people with disabilities into the design of accessibility to the vaccine. I commend FEMA for making the necessary efforts in continuing to make the vaccine more accessible for people with disabilities.” 

FEMA provides live on-demand American Sign Language interpreters at all federally supported community vaccination centers during each center’s hours of operation. FEMA also has civil rights and disability integration advisors in each of its 10 regions to advise state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, and other partners, ensuring the needs of people with disabilities are integrated in all facets of vaccination center operations. For further details on your region’s Disability Integration Specialist, contact FEMA at [FEMA-Disability-Integration-Coordination@fema.dhs.gov](mailto:FEMA-Disability-Integration-Coordination@fema.dhs.gov).
