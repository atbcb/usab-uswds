President Joe Biden has appointed [Olivia Mae M. Asuncion, AIA](https://www.access-board.gov/about/board-members/olivia-mae-m-asuncion/), as a Public Member to the U.S. Access Board. Asuncion succeeds Board Public Member Karen Braitmayer, who had been appointed by President Barack Obama and served as Board Chair and Vice-Chair in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Asuncion brings a breadth of knowledge in the architecture field and of experiences with an accessible design perspective. Â 

Asuncion has built her career path toward creating accessible communities and advocating for inclusive design as a licensed architect and design researcher from Oakland, California. She began her career by helping Bay Area non-profit organizations with their construction, project, and property management needs, including the Ed Roberts Campus, a universally designed building in Berkeley that hosts several disability organizations. Her career then expanded extensively to include accessibility in the design and construction of public safety buildings, public sector office and community spaces, and K-12 educational facilities. Additionally, Asuncion has led or participated in a wide range of projects, both nationally and internationally, and presented on the importance of inclusivity and accessibility in the built environment to university students and design professionals. 

The Board is an independent federal agency that provides leadership in accessible design under the ADA and other laws. The Board is structured to function as a coordinating body among federal agencies and to directly represent the public, particularly people with disabilities. Twelve members of the governing Board are representatives from most of the federal departments. The other thirteen are comprised of members of the public appointed by the President to four-year terms.
