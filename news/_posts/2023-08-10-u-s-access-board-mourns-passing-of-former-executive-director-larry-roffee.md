With deep sorrow, the U.S. Access Board announces the passing of former Executive Director Larry Roffee. He was appointed Executive Director of the Board in November 1988 and held the position for 20 years before retiring from federal service in August 2008. Mr. Roffee served in the U.S. Army as a Second Lieutenant in Vietnam in 1969 and 1970 and was wounded in action in May 1970. On August 9, 2023, Roffee passed peacefully in Billings, Montana while on a cross country trip visiting national parks with his wife Maggie. 

“Larry was a force for accessibility,” Board Executive Director Sachin Pavithran remarked. “Even after his retirement, he continued to advocate for equal access for all people with disabilities. Many of us in the disability community will benefit from his hard work for years to come.” 

Following his service in Vietnam, Mr. Roffee worked for the Paralyzed Veterans of America and at all levels of the Selective Service System. In 1987, he served as the Program Manager for the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities before leading the Board as Executive Director. After retiring from the Board, Mr. Roffee opened LMR Consulting where he provided consulting services on disability policy, accessibility in the built environment, and federal management. He was also able to dedicate more time to a long-time passion of his: photography. [Roffee’s photography work](https://www.lawrenceroffeephotography.com/) includes travel, larger gatherings, and disability. His retirement was also spent with family and friends, and he and Maggie continued to support and advocate for disability rights and inclusion. 

Larry will be dearly missed, and the Access Board sends its condolences to Maggie and all their family and friends.
