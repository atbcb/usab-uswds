Each year, the U.S. Access Board visits a city outside of Washington, D.C. to learn about the state of accessibility around the country. During the week of July 7th, the Access Board traveled to New Orleans for its 2025 out-of-town Board meeting. On Wednesday, July 9th, the Board held its annual town hall meeting at the New Orleans Marriott, where it heard directly from city residents regarding local accessibility concerns. The event was held in conjunction with the [National Federation of the Blind (NFB)](https://nfb.org/) National Convention, which also took place at the Marriott.

Over 20 community members and National Convention attendees testified during the public comment portion of the town hall. Participants shared a range of accessibility concerns including, among others: public transportation, pedestrian facilities in the public right-of-way, self-service transaction machines, Section 508 enforcement, design for people who are neurodivergent, air travel, voting, maps, and braille signage. The full town hall recording is archived on the [Board’s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3tbOSkbvYw).

During the afternoon on Wednesday, Access Board Members and staff attended NFB’s Resolutions Committee meeting at the National Convention. This event provided the Board with valuable insights into emerging trends and developments from members of the blind and low vision communities.

The next meeting of the U.S. Access Board will take place virtually from October 27 – 29, 2025.
