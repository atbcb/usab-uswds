  Study Initiated on Equipping Passenger Aircraft with Wheelchair Restraint
  Systems

  The Access Board is undertaking a study that has the potential to advance
  access to air travel for passengers who use wheelchairs. As directed by
  Congress, this project will assess the feasibility of equipping passenger
  planes with restraint systems so that passengers can remain in their
  wheelchairs on flights. Having to transfer out of wheelchairs makes air travel
  very difficult, if not impossible, for many people with disabilities.

The Access Board is undertaking a study that has the potential to advance access to air travel for passengers who use wheelchairs. As directed by Congress, this project will assess the feasibility of equipping passenger planes with restraint systems so that passengers can remain in their wheelchairs on flights. Having to transfer out of wheelchairs makes air travel very difficult, if not impossible, for many people with disabilities.

The Board is conducting this study through the National Academy of Sciences’ [Transportation Research Board](http://www.trb.org/Main/Home.aspx)(TRB). TRB has organized a committee of experts to evaluate the feasibility of in-cabin wheelchair restraint systems. Members include experts in aircraft interiors and safety engineering, accessibility, wheelchair design and crash worthiness, airline operations, and other disciplines. Committee members will evaluate the design, engineering, and safety requirements for equipping aircraft with locking or tiedown mechanisms for non-motorized and motorized wheelchairs used as seats. If such restraint systems are found to be feasible, the committee will then assess the wheelchair restraint systems that can be used to accommodate passengers using wheelchairs through all phases of flight, from boarding to deplaning.

The committee will hold its first meeting February 5 – 6, 2020 at the Access Board’s conference center. Most sessions will be open to the public and available by web conference. Those attending in person do not need to register in advance, but [registration](http://www.trb.org/Calendar/Blurbs/180140.aspx) is required (free) to attend online.
