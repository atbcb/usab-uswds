The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and [Challenge.Gov](https://www.challenge.gov/) have launched *[Access for All](https://www.challenge.gov/?challenge=access-for-all)*, a student design competition for barrier-free spaces in federal buildings. GSA invites students in architecture and design programs to apply universal design ideas to reimagine a federal workspace that provides an accessible, barrier-free, and all-inclusive experience. 

Federal facilities are required to comply with the [Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) Accessibility Standards.](https://www.access-board.gov/aba/) The standards provide minimum scoping and technical requirements for accessibility to sites, facilities, buildings, and elements by individuals with disabilities. The *Access for All* competition aims to find innovative solutions to reduce barriers so that all people with disabilities have access to federal buildings and facilities. 

Applications for the competition are due by **May 1, 2023** via [GSA’s "ACCESS FOR ALL" Universal Design in Federal Facilities webpage](https://www.challenge.gov/?challenge=access-for-all).
