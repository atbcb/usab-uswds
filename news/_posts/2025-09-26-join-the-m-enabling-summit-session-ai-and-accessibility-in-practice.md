**Session Overview:** Artificial intelligence is changing how organizations implement accessible ICT. This session walks through one example of integrating Artificial Intelligence using the Accessibility Requirements Tool (ART) and Solicitation Review Tool (SRT) to evaluate solicitations, flag gaps, and provide recommended solicitation language to improve accessible outcomes. Attendees will get an overview of SRT’s evolution from machine-learning algorithms to integration of a Large Language Model API and Retrieval Augmented Generation model. Hear lessons learned from integrating AI features specifically to promote accessibility requirements across procurement, development, and testing.

**Featured Speaker:** Andrew Nielson, Director, Government-wide IT Accessibility Program, GSA
