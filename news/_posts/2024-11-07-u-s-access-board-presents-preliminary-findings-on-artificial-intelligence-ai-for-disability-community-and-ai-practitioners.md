As part of the Developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) Equity, Access & Inclusion for All Series, the Access Board will present its preliminary findings on the risks and benefits of AI for people with disabilities. The findings are based on the outcomes of three recent AI hearings held in August 2024, independent research and engagements, as well as comments received from the public. **The presentation will take place virtually on Tuesday, January 14, 2025, from 2:00 – 3:30 p.m. (ET).** Please note that this session has been rescheduled from its original date in December.

This presentation supports the Access Board’s work in fulfilling the [Executive Order on the Use of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/) to engage with disability community members and AI practitioners to learn about the risks and benefits of AI, and to issue recommendations and technical assistance to promote equity, accessibility, and inclusion for all.  

The AI Equity, Access & Inclusion for All Series stems from the Board’s [Memorandum of Understanding](https://www.access-board.gov/news/2024/05/15/u-s-access-board-holds-signing-of-artificial-intelligence-memorandum-of-understanding-with-disability-and-technology-partners/) with the [American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD)](https://www.aapd.com/) and the [Center for Democracy & Technology (](https://cdt.org/)CDT). In total, five web-based activities will have been conducted: a [level setting session](https://www.access-board.gov/news/2024/06/27/developing-artificial-intelligence-ai-equity-access-inclusion-for-all-series-launch/) (on July 9), [three virtual hearing sessions](https://www.access-board.gov/news/2024/07/09/u-s-access-board-holds-hearings-on-artificial-intelligence-ai-for-disability-community-and-ai-practitioners/) - including two for the disability community (on August 8) and one for federal agency and AI industry practitioners (on August 22), and this upcoming presentation on the preliminary findings (on January 14).
