The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has published the First Call Public Working Draft of its Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0, which are developed through the W3C process in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world. [WCAG 3.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/) provides new ways to evaluate web content accessibility for people with disabilities by addressing more types of disabilities, concentrating on both mobile and desktop applications, and developing new tests and scoring to determine accessibility. 

While WCAG 3.0 would succeed WCAG 2.1 and 2.0, it would not deprecate these earlier versions. WCAG 3.0 covers a wider set of user and disability needs, publishing requirements, and emerging technologies such as web XR (augmented, virtual, and mixed reality) and voice input. WCAG 3.0 also includes non-normative information about web technologies working in conjunction with authoring tools, user agents, and assistive technologies. The WCAG 3.0 model is designed to support better coverage across disabilities and be easier to maintain so that the model keeps pace with accelerating technology change.

Since the late 1990s, the Board and the WCAG working groups have engaged in ongoing collaboration to make web content more accessible to users with disabilities. The Board’s original Section 508 Standards (2000) cited WCAG 1.0 and included a mapping between specific WCAG 1.0 checkpoints and 508 provisions. The refreshed 508 Standards (2017) incorporate significant portions of WCAG 2.0 by reference. 

The finalized WCAG 3.0 standards are not expected to be completed until after 2022. To submit feedback, [file an issue in the W3C Silver GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/silver/issues/new). Please file one issue per discrete comment. If filing issues in GitHub is not feasible, send an email to [public-agwg-comments@w3.org](public-agwg-comments@w3.org) or [public-silver@w3.org](public-silver@w3.org). The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group requests comments on this draft be sent by **February 26, 2021**.
