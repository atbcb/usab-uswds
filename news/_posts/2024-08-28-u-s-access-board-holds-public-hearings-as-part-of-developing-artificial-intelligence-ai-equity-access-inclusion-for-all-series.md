Throughout the month of August, the U.S. Access Board held a [series of public hearings](https://www.access-board.gov/news/2024/07/09/u-s-access-board-holds-hearings-on-artificial-intelligence-ai-for-disability-community-and-ai-practitioners/) on the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on people with disabilities. On August 8, two hearings (in the morning and afternoon) were held to hear from members of the disability community. Additionally, a panel of speakers delivered remarks on the risks, benefits, and potential of artificial intelligence with respect to accessibility.

The morning panel included representatives from the [American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD)](https://www.aapd.com/), [Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT)](https://cdt.org/), [Deaf Equality](https://www.deafequality.org/), [American Foundation for the Blind](https://www.afb.org/), [University of North Carolina at Charlotte](https://www.charlotte.edu/), and [University of Washington Center for Research and Education on Accessible Technology and Experiences](https://create.uw.edu/). The session was chaired by Access Board Vice-Chair **[Elver Ariza-Silva](https://www.access-board.gov/about/board-members/elver-ariza-silva/)**.

In the afternoon on August 8, the panel was comprised of representatives from AAPD, CDT, [the Consumer Federal Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/), [National Disability Institute](https://www.nationaldisabilityinstitute.org/), [National Council on Independent Living](https://ncil.org/), [National Association of Councils on Developmental Disabilities](https://nacdd.org/), [TDI for Access](https://tdiforaccess.org/), [GoSign.AI](https://www.gosign.ai/), and [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights](https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/index.html). The session was chaired by Access Board Chair **[Katy Kale](https://www.access-board.gov/about/board-members/federal-gsa/)**.

Later in the month on August 22, the Board held a third public hearing to learn from federal and AI industry practitioners. A diverse collection of voices from the artificial intelligence field delivered remarks on the current and future potential of AI for accessibility. Moreover, a panel comprised of federal AI leaders and AI practitioners also spoke on the risks and benefits of artificial intelligence. The agencies and organizations represented include the [General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov/), [Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law](https://www.bazelon.org/), [U.S. Department of Labor Office of Disability Employment Policy](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/odep), [U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission](https://www.eeoc.gov/), [Federal Communications Commission Disability Rights Office](https://www.fcc.gov/accessibility), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/accessibility/), [Global Accessibility Awareness Day Foundation](https://accessibility.day/), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights, [Ontario College of Art & Design University's Inclusive Design Research Centre](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/), and [Accessibility Standards Canada](https://accessible.canada.ca/). The session was chaired by Vice-Chair **Elver Ariza-Silva**.

All three hearings were recorded and are available on the [Access Board’s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5tRWTtV5eSw68N3tSpmyWw). ASL interpretation and real-time captioning were provided during all sessions.

In addition to delivering remarks at the hearings, members of the public have been invited to send in written comments on the impact of AI on accessibility and people with disabilities. **Please note that the period for submitting written comments has been extended to October 31, 2024.** Visit the Board’s [AI page](https://www.access-board.gov/ai/) for more information on how to submit written comments either over email or via the [docket on Regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/document/ATBCB-2024-0005-0001).

These hearings helped to support the Board’s work in fulfilling the [Executive Order on the Use of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/) by engaging with disability community members and AI practitioners to learn about the risks and benefits of AI. Ultimately, this work will help inform the Access Board as it issues recommendations and technical assistance on AI.

Additionally, these hearings are part of the **Developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) Equity, Access & Inclusion for All Series**, which stems from the Board’s [Memorandum of Understanding](https://www.access-board.gov/ai-mou/) with AAPD and CDT. This collaborative partnership seeks to help ensure that people with disabilities benefit from AI while being protected from its risks.
