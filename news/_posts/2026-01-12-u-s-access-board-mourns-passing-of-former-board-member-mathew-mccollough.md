The U.S. Access Board mourns the passing of former Public Board Member Mathew McCollough, who was appointed by President Obama in 2011 and served until 2022. Mat was a leader and advocate for accessibility, especially within the District of Columbia. In 2017, he was named Director of the DC Office of Disability Rights (ODR), and prior to this role, Mat served as Executive Director of the DC Developmental Disabilities Council (DDC).

Regarding his passing, Access Board Executive Director Sachin Pavithran remarked, “I had the great pleasure of knowing Mat for over two decades both professionally and as a friend as we both strived to make our nation more accessible to people with disabilities. While serving together as Access Board Members, I saw Mat’s passion and drive firsthand, and the United States is undoubtedly a more accessible place to live thanks to his efforts. He will be missed.”

In addition to the Access Board, Mat served on several other boards and commissions, including the District of Columbia State Rehabilitation Council, Mid-Atlantic Regional Health Equity Council, and the District of Columbia Commission on Human Rights. Most recently, he was elected Board President of the National Association of Councils on Developmental Disabilities—marking the first time that the Association elected a president with developmental disabilities.

The Access Board remembers the lifetime of service that Mathew McCollough gave to the disability community and sends its condolences to his wife and family, friends, and colleagues.
