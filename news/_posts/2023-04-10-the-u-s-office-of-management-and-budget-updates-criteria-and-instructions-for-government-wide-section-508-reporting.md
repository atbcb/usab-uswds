The U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has provided updated criteria and instructions for federal agencies to report on the implementation of [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/). Section 508 of the [Rehabilitation Act](https://www.access-board.gov/law/ra.html) requires federal departments and agencies to develop, procure, maintain, or use information and communications technology (ICT) that is accessible to people with disabilities and to give employees and members of the public with disabilities access to information. In December, Congress required federal agencies to report on the implementation of Section 508 to OMB and the General Services Administration (GSA) in accordance with the updated criteria and instructions. 

Agency reports are due on or before **August 11, 2023**. Agency reports should be submitted by the agency’s Section 508 Program Manager or designee starting June 1, 2023. The [assessment criteria](https://www.section508.gov/manage/section-508-assessment/criteria-01/), including general information and the questions, are available for assessment planning and reporting. Instructions for reporting, key dates, contact information, and other information are on the [Section508.gov Government-wide Section 508 Assessment webpage](https://www.section508.gov/manage/section-508-assessment/). 

Federal agency Section 508 reports assist OMB, GSA, the U.S. Access Board, and the Department of Justice in fulfilling statutory reporting requirements to evaluate agency implementation progress. GSA, in consultation with OMB, will issue a report to Congress, including a public data file that contains all agency responses, by Dec 29, 2023.
