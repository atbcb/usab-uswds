The U.S. Access Board remains committed to its work in advancing and embedding diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) in its workforce.

“This plan will ensure we continue to sustain and improve our workplace and workforce so that we can accomplish our mission,” Board Executive Director Sachin Pavithran remarked. “We aim to continue to be a model for diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility as we advance accessible design throughout all of society.” 

The plan includes a focus on culture, career, communication, and consistency to continue a work environment of opportunity, encouragement, transparency, and skill development.
