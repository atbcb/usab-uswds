The U.S. Access Board remains committed to its work in advancing and embedding diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) in its workforce. This week, the Board released its [DEIA Strategic Plan](https://www.access-board.gov/deia-strategic-plan/) that establishes goals, objectives, and actions to foster a workplace that exemplifies teamwork, embraces innovation, and values DEIA to achieve mission excellence.  

“This plan will ensure we continue to sustain and improve our workplace and workforce so that we can accomplish our mission,” Board Executive Director Sachin Pavithran remarked. “We aim to continue to be a model for diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility as we advance accessible design throughout all of society.” 

The plan includes a focus on culture, career, communication, and consistency to continue a work environment of opportunity, encouragement, transparency, and skill development. The Board will use these goals to maintain and increase DEIA in its workplace, optimize outreach efforts in furthering a high-performing DEIA workforce, and enhance training and policies for its operations.
