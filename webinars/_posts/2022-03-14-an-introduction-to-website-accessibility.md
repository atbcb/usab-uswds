title: An Introduction to Website Accessibility
date: 2022-05-05
excerpt: Everyone needs access to digital information provided by the World Wide
  Web. However, many websites have subtle barriers that prevent people with
  disabilities from using content. Fortunately, accessibility is not difficult
  to implement, and most accessibility features do not require significant
  changes to the visual presentation. This session will review what web
  accessibility is, how people with disabilities use the web, how to quickly
  identify accessibility barriers, and what are some simple solutions. Access
  Board IT Specialist Bruce Bailey will also clarify common sources of confusion
  about web accessibility and provide key resources for learning more about
  website accessibility. Questions can be submitted in advance of the session or
  can be posed during the live webinar. This webinar will include video remote
  interpreting (VRI) and real-time captioning. Webinar attendees can earn
  continuing education credits.
