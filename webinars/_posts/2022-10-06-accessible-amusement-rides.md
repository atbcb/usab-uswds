title: Accessible Amusement Rides
date: 2022-10-06
excerpt: Up and down, around and around! Amusement rides are enjoyed by many
  people, including those with disabilities. The 2010 ADA Standards for
  Accessible Design and the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards
  address accessibility for permanent amusement rides. For newly designed and
  constructed rides, scoping provisions provide the option to choose the type of
  access that is suitable for a particular ride or experience. Three options for
  providing accessibility onto a ride device include a wheelchair space on the
  ride, a ride seat designed for transfer, or a transfer device. This session
  will review the technical provisions for each type of access required on
  rides. Additionally, U.S. Access Board staff Bill Botten and Bobby Stinnette
  will address requirements for accessible routes, que lines, parking and
  passenger loading areas, signage, sales, and service counters. This webinar
  will include video remote interpreting (VRI) and real-time captioning.
  Questions can be submitted in advance of the session or can be posed during
  the live webinar. Webinar attendees can earn continuing education credits.
