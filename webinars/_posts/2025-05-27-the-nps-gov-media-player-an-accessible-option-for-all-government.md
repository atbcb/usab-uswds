title: "The NPS.gov Media Player: An Accessible Option for All Government"
date: 2025-05-27
excerpt: The Revised Section 508 Standards include a requirement (503.4) where a
  digital product displays video with synchronized audio, the product shall
  provide user controls for closed captions and audio descriptions at the same
  menu level as the user controls for volume or program selection. The National
  Park Service (NPS) within the Department of the Interior (DOI) has developed
  an open-source media player which conforms with the Revised Section 508
  Standard for user controls by ensuring that the caption control (CC) and audio
  description control (AD) buttons are visible along-side the other user
  controls. Over several years, the National Park Service has customized a media
  player which aims to be as accessible as possible. It supports multi-track
  audio and video, allowing a user to toggle between standard, described, and
  American Sign Language versions of a single video; it supports captioning in
  over 10 languages; and has been through several rounds of user testing with
  people who are blind / low vision. The code for this player is available on
  GitHub. Questions can be submitted in advance of the session or can be posed
  during the live webinar. Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) and real-time
  captioning will be provided.
