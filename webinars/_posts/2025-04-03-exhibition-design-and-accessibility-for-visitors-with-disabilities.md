title: "Exhibition Design and Accessibility for Visitors with Disabilities "
date: 2025-04-03
excerpt: Understanding and applying accessible design standards to provide
  access to museums and their exhibits can be challenging. When making design
  decisions, requirements for usability and effective communication are
  intricately tied to the process and may in turn influence the approach taken
  to produce good design and ensure accessibility. Using examples, the intricate
  relationship among effective communication, modifications of practices and
  procedures, and the built environment will be explored in this webinar. Human
  generated real-time captioning provided along with video sign language
  interpreters. Participants can ask questions in advance during the
  registration process as well as ask questions during the live session.
