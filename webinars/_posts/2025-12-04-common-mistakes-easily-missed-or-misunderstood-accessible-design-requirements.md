title: "Common Mistakes: Easily Missed or Misunderstood Accessible Design
  Requirements"
date: 2025-12-04
excerpt: Given the number of requirements found in the Americans with
  Disabilities Act and Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards, some
  are bound to be misinterpreted or forgotten. Although the mistake may be
  small, correcting the design after construction can be time-consuming and
  costly. The presenter will identify many of the most common accessibility
  mistakes made during the planning stages of a project. The focus of this
  webinar is to highlight frequently missed and misunderstood provisions in the
  Standards and to provide clear answers and requirements. Some of the elements
  to be covered include lavatories, doors, signs, and handrails. Real-time
  captioning provided along with video sign language interpreters. Participants
  can ask questions in advance during the registration process as well as ask
  questions during the live session.
