title: "Beyond the Alt Tag: Accessible Name "
date: 2023-03-28
excerpt: "The reasoning, best practices, and available technology for creating
  accessible images and text alternatives has evolved over the last several
  years. Expert web developers are building upon the foundation of text
  alternative techniques such as “alt tags” to newer concepts such as
  “Accessible Name” and “Accessible Description” for HTML. This approach
  provides better accessibility.  During this webinar, Access Board staff will
  describe how they employ these updated concepts when developing the Guides to
  the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Standards. Participants will
  understand the reason for these changes and will gain practical strategies for
  adding “Accessible Name” to their vocabulary and toolkits.  Target Audience:
  Open to all, but of noted interest for experienced web developers.  Questions
  can be submitted in advance of the session or can be posed during the live
  webinar. This webinar will include video remote interpreting (VRI) and
  real-time captioning."

### Description

The reasoning, best practices, and available technology for creating accessible images and text alternatives has evolved over the last several years. Expert web developers are building upon the foundation of text alternative techniques such as “alt tags” to newer concepts such as “Accessible Name” and “Accessible Description” for HTML. This approach provides better accessibility.

During this webinar, Access Board staff will describe how they employ these updated concepts when developing the Guides to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Standards. Participants will understand the reason for these changes and will gain practical strategies for adding “Accessible Name” to their vocabulary and toolkits.

Target Audience: Open to all, but of noted interest for experienced web developers.
