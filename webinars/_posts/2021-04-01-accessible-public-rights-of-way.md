title: Accessible Public Rights-of-Way
date: 2021-04-01
excerpt: Ensuring access to public streets and sidewalks can be a challenge
  since new guidelines for accessible public rights-of-way have not yet been
  finalized under the ADA. This webinar will review available resources in the
  interim, namely the guidelines that the Access Board previously proposed for
  public rights-of-way and shared use paths. Presenters will discuss common
  issues and solutions, as well as review proposed requirements for sidewalks
  and street crossings, curb ramps and blended transitions, detectable warnings,
  pedestrian signals, on-street parking, street furniture, transit stops, and
  other components of public rights-of-way and shared use paths. This webinar
  will include video remote interpreting (VRI) and real-time captioning.
  Questions can be submitted in advance of the session or can be posed during
  the live webinar. Webinar attendees can earn continuing education credits.
