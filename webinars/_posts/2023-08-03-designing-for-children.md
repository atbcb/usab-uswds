title: Designing for Children
date: 2023-08-03
excerpt: Children with disabilities need accessible design that differs from
  design for adults with disabilities, such as the dimensions of sinks and
  drinking fountains, dining surfaces, water closets and toilet compartments,
  and handrails. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Architectural
  Barriers Act (ABA) Accessibility Standards provide requirements that ensure
  daycares, preschools, elementary schools, play facilities, and children’s
  museums are designed with accessibility for children with disabilities. This
  webinar will review the scoping and technical requirements in the ADA and ABA
  Standards for spaces and elements specifically designed for use by people with
  disabilities who are 12 years old and younger. Presenters will discuss
  accessibility requirements for toilet rooms, classrooms, play areas and
  components, and ground surfaces. Special guest speaker Bill Botten will
  present and impart his knowledge from decades of accessibility advocacy for
  children and recreation. This webinar will include video remote interpreting
  (VRI) and real-time captioning. Participants may submit questions in advance
  of the webinar during the registration process or may ask questions during the
  live session.
