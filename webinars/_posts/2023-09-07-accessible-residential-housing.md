title: Accessible Residential Housing
date: 2023-09-07
excerpt: Independent living is one of the most critical elements of
  accessibility. Accessibility barriers within a person’s home, where they spend
  most of their time, are imperative to address.  Residential dwelling unit
  accessibility guidelines and standards are addressed under many laws,
  including the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA), the Americans with
  Disabilities Act (ADA), the Fair Housing Act, and Section 504 of the
  Rehabilitation Act, to ensure these facilities are accessible to people with
  disabilities. These laws, guidelines, and standards can be difficult to
  understand and lead to confusion for many design professionals, lawyers, and
  citizens. This session will clarify these requirements and their application
  to different types of residential facilities, including both privately and
  publicly funded facilities. Presenters from the U.S. Access Board and the U.S.
  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will review differences
  between Title II and III of the ADA and the ABA, as well as their overlap with
  HUD's 504 regulations of the Rehabilitation Act. Additionally, presenters will
  give an overview of the accessible design and construction requirements under
  the Fair Housing Act that apply broadly to most multifamily housing.  This
  session will have real-time captioning and sign language interpreters
  available.  Individuals may submit questions in advance of the session when
  they register for the session.

### Description

Independent living is one of the most critical elements of accessibility. Accessibility barriers within a person’s home, where they spend most of their time, are imperative to address.

Residential dwelling unit accessibility guidelines and standards are addressed under many laws, including the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Fair Housing Act, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, to ensure these facilities are accessible to people with disabilities. These laws, guidelines, and standards can be difficult to understand and lead to confusion for many design professionals, lawyers, and citizens. This session will clarify these requirements and their application to different types of residential facilities, including both privately and publicly funded facilities. Presenters from the U.S. Access Board and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will review differences between Title II and III of the ADA and the ABA, as well as their overlap with HUD's 504 regulations of the Rehabilitation Act. Additionally, presenters will give an overview of the accessible design and construction requirements under the Fair Housing Act that apply broadly to most multifamily housing.

This session will have real-time captioning and sign language interpreters available.
