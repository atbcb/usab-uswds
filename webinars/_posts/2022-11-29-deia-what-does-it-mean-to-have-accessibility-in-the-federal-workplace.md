title: "DEIA: What Does It Mean to Have Accessibility in the Federal Workplace?"
date: 2022-11-29
excerpt: President Biden's Executive Order to Advance Diversity, Equity,
  Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) in the Federal Workforce requires that
  federal workspaces must be fully accessible to employees with disabilities.
  This means that they must be designed and constructed to be accessible as
  required by the Architectural Barriers Act, which ensures access to federally
  funded facilities. Digital workspaces, including information and communication
  technology used by federal agencies, must be accessible as well under Section
  508 of the Rehabilitation Act. This session will review accessibility
  requirements for employee work areas in the ABA Accessibility Standards
  (ABAAS), including provisions for accessible routes, parking, entrances,
  workspaces, break rooms, locker rooms, and other areas. Presenters will also
  review requirements in the Section 508 Standards for computers,
  telecommunications equipment, software, websites, information kiosks and
  transaction machines, and electronic documents. Questions can be submitted in
  advance of the session or can be posed during the live webinar. This webinar
  will include video remote interpreting (VRI) and real-time captioning.
