title: That Doesn't Need to Be a PDF
date: 2025-07-29
excerpt: Hear how agencies can design an HTML-first approach for electronic
  content using “@media print” for a superior printing experience (because yes,
  some people do use paper) during a panel discussion with experts from FDIC,
  USAB, and GSA when a PDF document is the proper solution. Questions can be
  submitted in advance of the session or can be posed during the live webinar.
  Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) and real-time captioning will be provided.
