title: "Experiencing the Past: Accessibility in Historic Buildings and Facilities"
date: 2025-06-05
excerpt: Historic buildings and sites provide visitors with the opportunity to
  experience the past. Whether a 200-year-old historic home or a battlefield,
  historic buildings and sites give us a chance to feel what it might have been
  like to be where history was made, much more than just learning about historic
  events from books or movies. It is important that visitors with disabilities
  are also able to take advantage of these sensory-rich opportunities. In this
  webinar, presenters will provide an overview of the requirements in the
  Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA)
  accessibility standards relevant to qualified historic buildings and
  facilities, including basic requirements for alterations and specific
  exceptions for historic buildings and facilities. Presenters will discuss best
  design practices and other recommendations for making historic sites and
  facilities more accessible as well as approaches to providing facility and
  programmatic accessibility to a range of historic buildings and facilities.
  This webinar will include video remote interpreting (VRI) and real-time
  captioning. Questions can be submitted in advance of the session or can be
  posed during the live webinar. Webinar attendees can earn continuing education
  credits.
