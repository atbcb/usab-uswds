title: "Access to Medical Care Facilities, Exam Rooms, and Long-Term Care Facilities "
date: 2024-08-01
excerpt: Access to health facilities and equipment is a basic need. Whether it
  is a routine visit to the dentist, a problem appointment with the primary care
  physician or assistance with activities of daily living in a long-term care
  facility. Accessible medical facilities and equipment allow everyone,
  including people with disabilities, to actively participate in and manage
  their health. This presentation will address the Americans with Disabilities
  Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) for licensed medical care facilities
  including hospitals, rehabilitation, psychiatric and detoxification
  facilities, licensed long-term care and assisted living facilities, and
  facilities specializing in treating conditions that affect mobility. Design
  standards for medical diagnostic equipment will also be discussed. Video
  remote interpreting and real-time captioning will be provided in this webinar.
  Questions can be submitted in advance of the session during the registration
  process or may be posed during the live webinar.
