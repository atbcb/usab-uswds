title: Employee Work Areas and Break Rooms
date: 2024-03-07
excerpt: There is often a misconception that the ADA does not apply to Employee
  Only spaces, this is untrue. Exceptions do exist for Employee Work Areas, but
  all common use spaces need to be fully accessible, even those only serving
  employees. During this webinar, presenters will explain the differences
  between employee only areas and employee work areas and where exceptions
  apply. Additionally, they will cover the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) and
  Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements for the common areas that
  are most often found within employee only spaces, including accessible routes,
  break rooms/kitchenettes, and toilet rooms. Actual technical assistance
  scenarios will be used to provide real-life examples and further knowledge of
  applying the Standard to employee only and employee work areas. This session
  will offer real-time captioning and Video Remote Sign Language Interpreters.
  Individuals will be able to submit questions in advance during the
  registration process. Questions may also be submitted during the live session.
