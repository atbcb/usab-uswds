title: "Building a Successful Document Accessibility Program: Strategies,
  Methods, and Workplans for Inclusive Programs"
date: 2022-09-28
excerpt: NOTE CHANGE OF DATE--This session has been rescheduled to September 28, 2022 in observance of Rosh Hashanah. Accessibility programs are essential to ensuring federal agencies are
  inclusive of employees with disabilities, especially within digital work
  environments. While there is no universal method for developing effective
  accessibility programs, some strategies and practices are more successful than
  others. In the creation of digital documents, agencies frequently produce
  large volumes through the collaboration of many authors across federal
  departments, offices, and units. This session will discuss some common
  features, work processes, and evaluation and implementation actions of
  successful document accessibility programs. Presenters from Internal Revenue
  Service (IRS) and Social Security Administration (SSA) will review the
  importance of scoping and protocols in work-plans, the methods to maximize the
  effects of centralized document services, the effectiveness of partnering with
  internal groups that produce large volumes of documents, and the approaches to
  maximize training efforts by targeted recruitment.  This webinar will include
  video remote interpreting (VRI) and real-time captioning. Questions can be
  submitted in advance of the session or can be posed during the live webinar.
