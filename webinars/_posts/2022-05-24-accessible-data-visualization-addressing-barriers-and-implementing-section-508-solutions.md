  Section 508 Solutions"
date: 2022-05-24
excerpt: In the Digital Age, data visualizations have become more commonly
  developed to represent large data sets through graphics, charts, and other
  visuals. Federal agencies have used them to show patterns, trends, and
  outliers of data to inform members of the public, policy makers, and
  first-responders. This session will introduce the concept, development, tools,
  and benefits of data visualizations, including making them accessible.
  Presenters from the U.S. Department of Education, the Center for Disease
  Control, and the U.S. Census will discuss how their respective agencies use
  data visualizations to meet their missions. Presenters will also review some
  barriers, solutions, and implications to making accessible data
  visualizations. This session is intended for entry-level to intermediate
  audiences, but all are welcome to join. This webinar will include video remote
  interpreting (VRI) and real-time captioning. Questions can be submitted in
  advance of the session or can be posed during the live webinar.
