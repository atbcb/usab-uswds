title: Highlights from the Fiscal Year 2024 Government-wide Section 508 Assessment
date: 2025-01-21
excerpt: In late 2022, Congress enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act,
  Section 752, requiring the General Services Administration (GSA), in
  consultation with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to report
  annually on the Section 508 compliance of the federal government and each
  federal agency. The presenters will review an overview of the 2024 report to
  Congress, including the assessment criteria, survey results, and a highlight
  of key recommendations. Per the Act, OMB, in coordination with the GSA, the
  U.S. Access Board, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy
  developed the assessment criteria. Measurements of Section 508 program
  maturity include staffing levels, task organization and complaint processes.
  Conformance questions collected performance metrics for web, videos,
  documents, and selected enterprise applications, among other information and
  communication technologies. Questions can be submitted in advance of the
  session or can be posed during the live webinar. Video Remote Interpreting
  (VRI) and real-time captioning will be provided.
