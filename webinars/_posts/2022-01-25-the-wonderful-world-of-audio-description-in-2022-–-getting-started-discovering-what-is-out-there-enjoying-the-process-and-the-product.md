  types of accessible media, the basics of audio description, considerations in
  planning procurement and development of accessible video and multimedia, and
  best practices in providing audio description into media. Presenters will also

### Description

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires federal agencies to make their information and communication technology (ICT) accessible to people with disabilities. Planning for accessibility needs to be a part of the development and lifecycle plan of any ICT project, including video and multimedia projects. These types of projects can be accessible by providing audio description, or sometimes referred to as video description, which is used by persons who are blind or have low vision. Presenters will review different types of accessible media, the basics of audio description, considerations in planning procurement and development of accessible video and multimedia, and best practices in providing audio description into media. Presenters will also address agency successes, challenges, and limitations in the contracting process and implementation of audio description. Questions can be submitted in advance of the session or can be posed during the live webinar. Webinar attendees can receive a participation certificate.

Registration closes 24 hours before the start of the session. Instructions for accessing the webinar on the day of the session will be sent via email to registered individuals in advance of the session.
