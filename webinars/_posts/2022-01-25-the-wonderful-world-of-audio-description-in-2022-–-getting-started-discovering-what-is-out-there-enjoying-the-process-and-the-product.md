excerpt: Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires federal agencies to make
  their information and communication technology (ICT) accessible to people with
  disabilities. Planning for accessibility needs to be a part of the development

  projects. These types of projects can be accessible by providing audio
  description, or sometimes referred to as video description, which is used by
  persons who are blind or have low vision. Presenters will review different
  types of accessible media, the basics of audio description, considerations in
  planning procurement and development of accessible video and multimedia, and
  best practices in providing audio description into media. Presenters will also
  address agency successes, challenges, and limitations in the contracting
  process and implementation of audio description. Questions can be submitted in
  advance of the session or can be posed during the live webinar. This webinar
  will include video remote interpreting (VRI) and real-time captioning. Webinar
  attendees can receive a participation certificate.

### Description

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires federal agencies to make their information and communication technology (ICT) accessible to people with disabilities. Planning for accessibility needs to be a part of the development and lifecycle plan of any ICT project, including video and multimedia projects. These types of projects can be accessible by providing audio description, or sometimes referred to as video description, which is used by persons who are blind or have low vision. Presenters will review different types of accessible media, the basics of audio description, considerations in planning procurement and development of accessible video and multimedia, and best practices in providing audio description into media. Presenters will also address agency successes, challenges, and limitations in the contracting process and implementation of audio description. Questions can be submitted in advance of the session or can be posed during the live webinar. Webinar attendees can receive a participation certificate.

Registration closes 24 hours before the start of the session. Instructions for accessing the webinar on the day of the session will be sent via email to registered individuals in advance of the session. Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART) and Video Sign Language Interpreters are available for each session and will be broadcast via the webinar platform.

The Section 508 Best Practices Webinar Series provides helpful information and best practices for federal agencies in meeting their obligations under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act which ensures access to information and communication technology in the federal sector.
