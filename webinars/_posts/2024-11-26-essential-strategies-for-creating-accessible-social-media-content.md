title: Essential Strategies for Creating Accessible Social Media Content
date: 2024-11-26
excerpt: Every day, millions of Americans use social media to engage with their
  favorite brands and influencers – including the federal government. Federal
  agencies have a crucial duty to engage the public effectively, share important
  information, and provide essential services to all Americans, including
  individuals with disabilities. Among other requirements, Section 508 of the
  Rehabilitation Act mandates that federal agencies ensure equal access to
  social media content, data, and platforms. Join us for an engaging session
  where U.S. Access Board staff Amy Nieves, Public Affairs Specialist, and David
  O’Keefe, Events and Communication Specialist, will present essential
  strategies for federal social media managers and communication professionals
  to ensure their content is accessible to all audiences. Participants will gain
  a range of valuable techniques for crafting inclusive social media posts,
  writing effective alternative (alt) text, checking color contrast, using
  hashtags and emojis thoughtfully, and ensuring that video content is properly
  captioned, among other important topics. Sign language interpreting and real
  time captioning will be provided. Participants can submit questions to the
  presenter during the registration process and at the end of the webinar.
