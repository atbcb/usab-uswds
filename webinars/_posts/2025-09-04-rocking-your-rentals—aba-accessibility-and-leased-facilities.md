title: Rocking Your Rentals—ABA Accessibility and Leased Facilities
date: 2025-09-04
excerpt: Got a leased Federal facility? Then you don’t want to miss this
  webinar! The Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) requires that federal agencies
  and the US Postal Service (USPS) ensure that facilities they lease are
  accessible to people with disabilities. To meet this minimum level of
  accessibility, leased facilities must comply with a subset of requirements in
  the ABA Standards. These requirements address accessible routes, parking,
  toilet and bathing facilities, sales and service counters, joint use areas,
  fire alarms, and other elements and spaces. The presenter will review these
  requirements and explain how they apply to leased facilities. In addition, the
  requirement that alterations undertaken after the building has been leased
  must comply with any applicable requirements will be discussed. Real-time
  captioning provided along with video sign language interpreters. Participants
  can ask questions in advance during the registration process as well as ask
  questions during the live session.
