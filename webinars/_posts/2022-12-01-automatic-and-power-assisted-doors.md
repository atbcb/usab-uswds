excerpt: Entrances and doors are key components of access along routes and to
  buildings, rooms, and spaces. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and
  Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) Standards require automatic and
  power-assisted doors to comply with the standards when provided on accessible
  routes. The ADA and ABA Standards reference industry standards developed under
  protocols of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and published by
  the Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association (BHMA). This session will
  cover the scoping and technical requirements in the ADA and ABA Standards for
  entrances and doors when they are automatic or power-assisted. Presenters will
  review in detail the specifications in the ANSI/BHMA referenced standards that
  address operating characteristics, including opening speed, safety features,
  sensors and activation devices, labeling, among others. This webinar will
  include video remote interpreting (VRI) and real-time captioning. Questions
  can be submitted in advance of the session or can be posed during the live
