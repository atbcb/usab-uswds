title: Accessible Parking and Passenger Loading Zones
date: 2023-03-02
excerpt: People with mobility disabilities often have no problem driving to
  various buildings and facilities for employment, services, education,
  amenities, and to socialize. However, to access those sites, available parking
  must meet both the scoping and technical requirements of the Americans with
  Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA).  This session
  will address the requirements for parking spaces, van spaces, vertical
  clearances, access aisles, marking and signage, ground clearances, and valet
  parking, as well as accessible passenger loading zones. Access Board
  Accessibility Specialists will also present the recommendations for the design
  and construction of accessible electric vehicle (EV) charging stations located
  on both government and private entities.   Video remote interpreting and
  real-time captioning will be provided in this webinar. Questions can be
  submitted in advance of the session or may be posed during the live webinar.
  Participants can also earn continuing education credits.
