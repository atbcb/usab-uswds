title: Don’t Panic! How to Navigate the 2010 ADA Standards and HUD’s Deeming
  Notice (Part 1 of 2)
date: 2025-10-02
excerpt: Over the past 50 years, multiple Federal Laws have been established to
  ensure housing is accessible to people with disabilities. Two of these, the
  Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, have
  similar objectives and are closely interrelated. A multifamily housing project
  receiving federal financial assistance will likely have overlapping accessible
  design requirements from both these mandates. But don’t panic! While at first
  this can seem confusing and intimidating, there is a logical order and
  application of the accessibility Standards set forth in the respective
  statutes. Presenters from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
  (HUD) will review general differences between the ADA and the Rehabilitation
  Act, specifically HUD’s implementing section 504 regulations (504. The central
  focus will be reconciling the 2010 ADA Standards’ requirements with those of
  the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards as required by the 504 through
  HUD’s “Deeming Notice”. Key scope requirements will be highlighted and
  critical differences between the various Standards discussed. The session will
  focus in detail on HUD’s “deeming notice” that permits state and local
  governments to align their housing efforts more closely with requirements of
  the ADA Standards. The Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) relationship to the
  Standards will also be succinctly reviewed with several key issues
  highlighted. This is the first webinar session of a two-part series and will
  focus on application and scoping concerns that lead to the technical
  requirements. Real-time captioning provided along with video sign language
  interpreters. Participants can ask questions in advance during the
  registration process as well as ask questions during the live session.
