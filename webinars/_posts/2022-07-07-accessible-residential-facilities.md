title: Accessible Residential Facilities
date: 2022-07-07
excerpt: Accessibility guidelines and standards issued under the Architectural
  Barriers Act (ABA), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Fair
  Housing Act, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act apply to residential
  dwelling units to ensure these facilities are accessible to people with
  disabilities. These laws, guidelines, and standards can be difficult to
  understand and lead to confusion for many design professionals, lawyers, and
  citizens. This session will clarify these laws and their application in the
  ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines for residential facilities. Presenters
  from the U.S. Access Board and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
  Development (HUD) will review differences between Title II and III of the ADA
  and the ABA, as well as their overlap with HUD’s 504 regulations of the
  Rehabilitation Act. Additionally, presenters will highlight accessible design
  and construction requirements under the Fair Housing Act that apply broadly to
  most multifamily housing. The session will also cover scoping and technical
  requirements in the ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines for work surfaces,
  turning space, accessible routes, reach ranges, and windows in residential
  dwelling units.  Session participants are encouraged to share their own areas
  of confusion and submit questions in advance of the session. Questions can
  also be posed during the live webinar. This webinar will include video remote
  interpreting (VRI) and real-time captioning. Webinar attendees can earn
  continuing education credits.
