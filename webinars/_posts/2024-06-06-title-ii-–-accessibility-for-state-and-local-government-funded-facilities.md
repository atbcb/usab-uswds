title: Title II – Accessibility for State and Local Government Funded Facilities
date: 2024-06-06
excerpt: The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has five “Titles”, that
  provide different protections for people with disabilities. Title II of the
  ADA specifically covers Public Services provided by any state or local
  government. Access Board Accessibility
  Specialists will review what the different accessibility laws are, how they
  apply, and compare how the requirements for state or local government entities
  differ than those in the private sector. In addition to these concepts, the
  accessibility specialists will cover a broad overview of key components that
  are likely to apply to government funded spaces, such as accessible routes,
  toilet rooms, and counters. This session will have real time captioning and
  sign language interpreters available. Individuals are able to submit questions
  for the speakers in advance through the on-line registration process.
