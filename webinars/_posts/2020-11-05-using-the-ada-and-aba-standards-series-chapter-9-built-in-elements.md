This session will review scoping and technical provisions for built-in elements in the ADA and ABA Accessibility Standards (Chapter 9). When errors are made in the design or construction of built-in elements, they can pose barriers to people with disabilities in accessing goods and services. This session will address the requirements for dining & work surfaces, benches, check-out aisles and sales & service counters. Presenters will address common sources of confusion and frequently asked questions about these provisions.
