title: Demystifying the Procurement Process
date: 2024-03-26
excerpt: Procurement and accessibility go together like peanut butter and jelly.
  Procurement is a fancy way of saying “personal shopper.” It may seem like a
  daunting process but with the right tools and attitude, it can be a fun
  experience. This webinar will provide an informative and consumable discussion
  on the acquisition lifecycle. In addition, there will be a particular emphasis
  on how accessibility fits into the lifecycle, stakeholder roles and
  responsibilities, and useful tools. Finally, the presenters will guide
  attendees through the process using a “real life scenario”, providing a
  foundation that can be applied to any information and communication technology
  (ICT) buy. Target audience is anyone involved and/or interested in
  accessibility, procurement, or both (i.e. everyone). Questions can be
  submitted in advance of the session or can be posed during the live webinar.
  The session will have captioning and video Sign Language Interpreter
  available. Questions for the speakers can be submitted in advance once you
  have registered for the session.
