title: Emergency Transportable Housing
date: 2023-12-07
excerpt: When a disaster strikes, survivors may need to relocate to emergency
  housing, including travel trailers, park models, manufactured housing, or
  other factory-built housing. It is crucial that disaster survivors with
  disabilities have access to these services as required under the Architectural
  Barriers Act (ABA) and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ABA
  Accessibility Guidelines ensure emergency transportable housing units are
  readily accessible to and usable by disaster survivors with disabilities. This
  webinar will review the scoping and technical requirements for residential
  dwelling units and the additional requirements or exceptions that apply
  specifically to emergency transportable housing units with mobility features
  and communication features.  Video remote interpreting and real-time
  captioning will be provided in this webinar.  Questions can be submitted in
  advance of the session or may be posed during the live webinar.  Participants
  can also earn continuing education credits.
