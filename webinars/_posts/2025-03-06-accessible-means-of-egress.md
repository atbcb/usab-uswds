title: Accessible Means of Egress
date: 2025-03-06
excerpt: Building and life safety codes require that facilities provide
  accessible means of egress so that all people, including those with
  disabilities, can relocate and evacuate in a timely and safe manner. The 2010
  ADA Accessibility Standards and the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility
  Standards reference the International Building Code (IBC) for accessible means
  of egress. In this session, an International Code Council representative and
  Access Board staff will provide an overview of the minimum technical
  requirements for accessible means of egress in the IBC, including criteria for
  emergency evacuation for people with disabilities, evacuation planning,
  alarms, evacuation route inside and outside of the building, and signage.
  Human generated real-time captioning provided along with video sign language
  interpreters. Participants can ask questions in advance during the
  registration process as well as ask questions during the live session.
