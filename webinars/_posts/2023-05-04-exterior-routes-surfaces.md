title: Exterior Routes & Surfaces
date: 2023-05-04
excerpt: Access to buildings begins with an accessible route and ground surfaces
  to ensure people who use mobility devices and canes can move from site
  arrival, frequently outdoors, to the entrance. This session will address the
  requirements for exterior routes and surfaces to ensure everyone has access
  within all spaces on a site. Access Board Accessibility Specialists will
  review the differences between accessible routes for building sites, outdoor
  recreation areas, trails, and beaches. Additionally, the presenters will share
  information on the concepts of stable, firm, and slip resistant surfaces in
  the outdoor environment. Playground surfaces will also be covered. Video
  remote interpreting and real-time captioning will be provided in this webinar.
  Questions can be submitted in advance of the session or may be posed during
  the live webinar. Participants can also earn continuing education credits.
