  Under the ADA and ABA Accessibility Standards, an accessible route must
  connect to all accessible elements and spaces on a site. This session will
  provide an in-depth review of requirements for accessible routes and related
  issues such as overlapping clear space requirements and door maneuvering
  clearances. The session will also address exterior routes such as site arrival
  points, connections to transit stops and public streets and sidewalks, and
  unique accessible route exceptions permitted at recreation facilities.
  Presenters will highlight some of the more frequently asked questions and
  common source of confusion for accessible routes. This webinar will include
  video remote interpreting (VRI) and real-time captioning. Questions can be
