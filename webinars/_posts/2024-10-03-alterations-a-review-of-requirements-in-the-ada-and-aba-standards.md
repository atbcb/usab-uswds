title: "Alterations: A Review of Requirements in the ADA and ABA Standards"
date: 2024-10-03
excerpt: Determining what is required to be accessible when an existing facility
  is altered or expanded can be a challenge. This session will review how the
  2010 ADA Accessibility Standards and the Architectural Barriers Act
  Accessibility Standards apply to planned alterations and additions. Presenters
  will clarify common sources of confusion, including what type of work
  constitutes an alteration, how the scope of work determines application, the
  exception for technical infeasibility, the provisions for primary function
  areas and accessible paths of travel, some exceptions specific to alterations,
  and the exceptions for historic facilities. This webinar will include video
  remote interpreting (VRI) and real-time captioning. Participants may submit
  questions in advance of the webinar during the registration process or may ask
  questions during the live session.
