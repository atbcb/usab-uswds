title: Doors and Gates
date: 2024-05-02
excerpt: Doors and gates are a significant aspect of almost all accessible
  routes within a site connecting buildings, rooms, and spaces. The Americans
  with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) Accessibility
  Standards address the many components to make a door accessible, including
  opening force, hardware, and maneuvering clearances. Access Board
  Accessibility Specialists will review the requirements for manual, automatic,
  and power-assisted doors, doorways, and gates as part of an accessible route.
  Video remote interpreting and real-time captioning will be provided in this
  webinar. Questions can be submitted in advance of the session or may be posed
  during the live webinar. Participants can also earn continuing education
  credits.
