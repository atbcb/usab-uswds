title: "The Born-Accessible Design Approach: Cost-Effective, Inclusive, Compliant"
date: 2026-01-20
excerpt: "NOTE TIME CHANGE: This session will begin at 12:30 pm Eastern Time.
  Most digital technologies are still built and released then remediated for
  accessibility later--an expensive, inefficient, and exclusionary process. In
  contrast, the born-accessible approach ensures that accessibility is built in
  from the start, by involving people with disabilities at every stage of
  design, development, and procurement. This user-centered strategy improves
  productivity, enhances user experience, reduces costs, and helps meet legal
  and regulatory requirements. Join us to explore practical frameworks, key
  components, and emerging research to help make born-accessible design a key
  part of your digital accessibility strategy. Real-Time Captioning and Video
  Sign Language will be provided. Individuals may submit questions in advance of
  the session during the registration process."
