The ADA Accessibility Standards apply to the wide range of facilities covered by the ADA, including places of public accommodation, commercial facilities, and state and local government. This two-part session will provide an overview of the 2010 ADA Standards and review scoping and technical requirements for new construction and alterations with a focus on common sources of confusion. Part I will cover application of the standards and which rooms and spaces must comply, exempt areas and structures, employee work areas, accessible entrances and routes, and operable parts (Chapters 1 – 5). Part II will cover accessible toilet and bathing facilities, signs and other communication features, dining and work surfaces, and sales and service counters (Chapters 6 – 9).

Learning Objectives:

Participants of this session will:

* understand how to correctly apply the ADA Accessibility Standards to sites and facilities in new construction according to application and scoping requirements in Chapters 1 and 2;
* gain an understanding of those features that make entrances, routes, and operable parts accessible in compliance with the ADA Accessibility Standards;
* learn how various requirements in the standards apply and are met in the design of accessible toilet rooms and bathing facilities; and
* learn answers to frequently asked questions and common sources of confusion in the ADA Accessibility Standards.
