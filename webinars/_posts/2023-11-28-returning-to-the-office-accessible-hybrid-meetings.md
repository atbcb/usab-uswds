title: "Returning to the Office: Accessible Hybrid Meetings"
date: 2023-11-28
excerpt: Federal workspaces are required to be accessible in both physical and
  online environments. During the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
  widespread transition to telework made use of virtual meetings and conferences
  commonplace. Now that agencies are transitioning to a workspace which may be
  either physical or virtual or a hybrid of both, there are novel issues facing
  federal accessibility specialists. This webinar will provide a review of the
  requirements for making the physical environment accessible under the
  Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) and the virtual
  environment accessible under Section 508. Presenters will also offer
  recommendations and best practices, as well as identify available resources to
  maximize participation in the federal workspace, whether virtual, physical, or
  hybrid. Questions can be submitted in advance of the session or can be posed
  during the live webinar. Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) and real-time
  captioning will be provided.

### Description

Federal workspaces are required to be accessible in both physical and online environments. During the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, the widespread transition to telework made use of virtual meetings and conferences commonplace. Now that agencies are transitioning to a workspace which may be either physical or virtual or a hybrid of both, there are novel issues facing federal accessibility specialists. This webinar will provide a review of the requirements for making the physical environment accessible under the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) and the virtual environment accessible under Section 508. Presenters will also offer recommendations and best practices, as well as identify available resources to maximize participation in the federal workspace, whether virtual, physical, or hybrid.

Attendees will learn:  

1. The requirements for making offices, conference rooms, and assembly areas accessible under the ABA. 
2. How the Section 508 Standards and WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria work to ensure an accessible online environment for all.  
3. How accommodations can improve the experience of federal employees in both physical and virtual environments.  

This session is intended for entry-level to intermediate audiences, but all are welcome to join.  

Questions can be submitted in advance of the session or can be posed during the live webinar. Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) and real-time captioning will be provided.
