title: Designing Accessible Crosswalks
date: 2024-02-01
excerpt: Crosswalks are a very important part of pedestrian circulation paths,
  enabling pedestrians to safely cross the vehicular way. It is important that
  crosswalks be accessible to all pedestrians, including those with
  disabilities. This webinar will review the requirements in the Public
  Rights-of-Way Accessibility Guidelines (PROWAG) for designing accessible
  crosswalks. The definition and practical meaning of "crosswalk" will be
  clarified, as well as requirements for indicating when pedestrian crossing is
  not intended at an intersection. Presenters will outline requirements for curb
  ramps, blended transitions, and detectable warnings, which provide physical
  access to the crosswalk; requirements for grade, cross slope, medians, and
  pedestrian refuge islands, which provide a pedestrian access route through the
  crosswalk; and requirements for accessible pedestrian signals, which ensure
  access to information provided by walk indications and pedestrian activated
  warning devices to pedestrians who are blind or who have low vision.
  Requirements for crosswalks at roundabouts and channelized turn lanes will
  also be covered. Video remote interpreting and real-time captioning will be
  provided in this webinar. Questions can be submitted in advance of the session
  during the registration process or may be posed during the live webinar.
