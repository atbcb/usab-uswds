title: Highlights from the new Government-wide Section 508 Assessment
date: 2024-01-30
excerpt: At the end of 2022, Congress enacted the Consolidated Appropriations
  Act, Section 752. This required an update of Section 508 Assessment Criteria
  across government. During 2023, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) the
  General Services administration (GSA), the U.S. Access Board (USAB) and the
  Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) at the White House worked
  closely together developing new Section 508 Assessment Criteria. The Criteria
  were used to create a survey containing 105 questions, targeting specific
  areas of agency Section 508 programs. The survey was disseminated across
  government. Forty questions addressed accessibility program maturity, 43
  addressed conformance questions, eliciting specific performance metrics for
  web, hardware, software, documents, and selected enterprise applications,
  among other features. Finally, there were 22 general information questions
  about Section 508 programs themselves, asking about staffing levels, task
  organization, and complaint processes, to name a few. Once agencies submitted
  their responses, GSA, OSTP, OMB and USAB analyzed and compiled the results
  into a report which was submitted to Congress in December 2023. The report
  contained summaries of the conclusions derived from analysis of the data
  received, as well as recommendations to Congress for further action to improve
  508 Implementation across government. This webinar will review the processes
  used to create maturity metrics, discuss some of the analysis used in
  evaluating the survey results, and touching on the recommendations in the
  report. Questions can be submitted in advance of the session or can be posed
  during the live webinar. Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) and real-time
  captioning will be provided.
