title: Maps for All – Building Accessible Maps
date: 2023-09-26
excerpt: Maps are important tools in providing information about the world. They
  help us travel from one location to another, organize information, and orient
  ourselves so that we can determine where we are and how to get to where we
  want to go. Federal and state agencies use maps to inform members of the
  public and policy makers, and to assist agency employees in conducting their
  missions by providing vital information. Online maps, designed without
  accessibility features, present barriers to individuals with
  disabilities.  This session will introduce the concept, development, tools,
  and benefits of creating and using accessible maps. Presenters from the
  General Services Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the
  Minnesota Department of Natural Resources of the State of Minnesota will
  discuss how they create accessible maps in different formats to meet their
  missions of informing and educating the public. Presenters will also review
  some barriers, solutions, and implications to making accessible data
  visualizations. This session is intended for entry-level to intermediate
  audiences, but all are welcome to join. This webinar will include video remote
  interpreting (VRI) and real-time captioning. Questions can be submitted in
  advance of the session or can be posed during the live webinar.

### Description

Maps are important tools in providing information about the world. They help us travel from one location to another, organize information, and orient ourselves so that we can determine where we are and how to get to where we want to go. Federal and state agencies use maps to inform members of the public and policy makers, and to assist agency employees in conducting their missions by providing vital information. Online maps, designed without accessibility features, present barriers to individuals with disabilities.

This session will introduce the concept, development, tools, and benefits of creating and using accessible maps. Presenters from the General Services Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources of the State of Minnesota will discuss how they create accessible maps in different formats to meet their missions of informing and educating the public. Presenters will also review some barriers, solutions, and implications to making accessible data visualizations.

During this webinar, presenters will share the following information.

* Common barriers to accessing maps for users with disabilities.
* Useful design principles that make maps easier to use.
* Best practices for creating accessible static digital maps.
* Designs to ensure interactive web maps can be used by a mouse, keyboard, or voice commands.

This session is intended for entry-level to intermediate audiences, but all are welcome to join. This webinar will include video remote interpreting (VRI) and real-time captioning. Questions can be submitted in advance of the session or can be posed during the live webinar.
