title: "Beyond Section 508 Digital Accessibility Requirements: An Overview of
  Web Accessibility Requirements from WCAG 2.1 and 2.2"
date: 2024-07-30
excerpt: WCAG 2.0 Level AA became the web accessibility requirement under
  Section 508 in March of 2017. WCAG 2.1 became a finalized standard in June of
  2018 and WCAG 2.2 became a finalized standard in in October 2023. The Europe
  Union has been using WCAG 2.1 for five years. In April 2023, DOJ published a
  final rule setting WCAG 2.1 as the standard under ADA for state and local
  governments (Title II). If your organization is using only WCAG 2.0 Level AA
  to audit your web properties, what accessibility features are you missing?
  Bruce and Rachael will explore and answer this question by reviewing the
  Success Criteria added in WCAG 2.1 and 2.2 as well as AAA requirements from
