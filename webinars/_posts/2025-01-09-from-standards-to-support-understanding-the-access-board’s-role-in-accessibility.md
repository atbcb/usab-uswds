  Accessibility"

excerpt: Have you previously attended our webinars or reached out with questions
  and training about accessibility? You might be surprised to learn that some
  questions may be outside the scope of the U.S. Access Board’s Office of
  Information and Technical Services (OTIS). Join us for this informative
  webinar where we’ll explore the U.S. Access Board’s crucial role in creating,
  training, and enforcing accessibility standards for everything from buildings
  and public spaces to transportation and information and communication
  technology. Plus, we’ll explain areas in which other federal agencies lead and
  enforce specific accessibility standards. Don’t miss out on this opportunity
  to understand the full landscape of accessibility! Human generated real-time
  captioning provided along with video sign language interpreters. Participants
  can ask questions in advance during the registration process as well as ask
  questions during the live session.
