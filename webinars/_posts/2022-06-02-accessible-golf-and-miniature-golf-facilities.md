title: Accessible Golf and Miniature Golf Facilities
date: 2022-06-02
excerpt: Let’s get swinging on the fairways and greens! People with disabilities
  enjoy playing a round of golf or putt-putt during the summertime. The
  Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA)
  Accessibility Standards address the design and construction of golf and
  miniature golf courses for accessibility. This session will review the scoping
  and technical requirements for accessible golf and miniature golf courses.
  U.S. Access Board staff Bill Botten and Juliet Shoultz will also address
  frequently asked questions and common sources of confusion about accessibility
  at golf and miniature golf facilities.  For golf courses, presenters will
  review the technical provisions that address teeing grounds, putting greens,
  teeing stations at driving ranges, course weather shelters, golf car rental
  areas, bag drop areas, and course toilet rooms. Additionally, they will
  address the special criteria that permit the use of a "golf car passage" in
  lieu of the traditional accessible route to connect these spaces within the
  boundary of the course.  For miniature golf courses, presenters will review
  the scoping provisions for miniature golf that establish the minimum number of
  holes required to be accessible in newly constructed courses. They will also
  address the technical provisions for accessible routes on the playing surface
  or adjacent to the playing surface serving accessible holes, start of play
  areas, and the golf club reach range.  Questions can be submitted in advance
  of the session or can be posed during the live webinar. This webinar will
  include video remote interpreting (VRI) and real-time captioning. Webinar
  attendees can earn continuing education credits.

### Description

Let’s get swinging on the fairways and greens! People with disabilities enjoy playing a round of golf or putt-putt during the summertime. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) Accessibility Standards address the design and construction of golf and miniature golf courses for accessibility. This session will review the scoping and technical requirements for accessible golf and miniature golf courses. U.S. Access Board staff Bill Botten and Juliet Shoultz will also address frequently asked questions and common sources of confusion about accessibility at golf and miniature golf facilities.

For golf courses, presenters will review the technical provisions that address teeing grounds, putting greens, teeing stations at driving ranges, course weather shelters, golf car rental areas, bag drop areas, and course toilet rooms. Additionally, they will address the special criteria that permit the use of a "golf car passage" in lieu of the traditional accessible route to connect these spaces within the boundary of the course.

For miniature golf courses, presenters will review the scoping provisions for miniature golf that establish the minimum number of holes required to be accessible in newly constructed courses. They will also address the technical provisions for accessible routes on the playing surface or adjacent to the playing surface serving accessible holes, start of play areas, and the golf club reach range.

Questions can be submitted in advance of the session or can be posed during the live webinar. This webinar will include video remote interpreting (VRI) and real-time captioning. Webinar attendees can earn continuing education credits.
