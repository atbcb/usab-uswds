The Access Board provides both virtual and in-person training on its accessibility guidelines and standards to many different organizations, groups, and government agencies across the country and internationally. Training sessions focus on:

- **[Built Environment]({{ site.baseurl }}/buildings.html).**&nbsp; Standards in new construction and alterations for buildings and facilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) Accessibility Standards.
- **[Public Rights-of-Way]({{ site.baseurl }}/prowag/).**&nbsp; Proposed guidelines for access to sidewalks, pedestrian street crossings, pedestrian signals, shared use paths, and other components of public rights-of-way.
- **[Information and Communication Technology (ICT)]({{ site.baseurl }}/ict.html).**&nbsp; Accessibility standards for ICT in the federal sector covered by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, including computers, telecommunications equipment, multifunction office machines such as copiers that also operate as printers, software, websites, information kiosks and transaction machines, and electronic documents.
- **[Transportation Vehicles]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/vehicles/).**&nbsp; Requirements for new or remanufactured transportation vehicles covered by the ADA, including buses and vans, rail cars, automated guideway vehicles, trams, and other modes of public transportation.
- **[Healthcare]({{ site.baseurl }}/healthcare.html).**&nbsp; Standards issued under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act for medical diagnostic equipment, including examination tables and chairs, weight scales, radiological equipment, and mammography equipment.

The Board tailors its training to the particular needs, timeframe, and interests of each audience. Board trainings are of particular interest to design professionals and architects, facility operators and managers, the transportation industry, the disability community, and members of other professions and groups that work with any of the Board’s guidelines and standards. Training sessions include time for question-and-answer participation. This kind of interaction is particularly helpful in gauging the information needs of the Board’s various audiences.

Many training sessions are held at the request of, or in partnership with, organizations or groups holding conferences and seminars that include accessibility and inclusion of persons with disabilities on the agenda. The Board also has a [conference space]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/venue.html) at its offices in Washington, D.C. that is sometimes used for trainings.

*Board policy requires that its in-person training sessions be conducted in accessible facilities and be communicated, upon request by attendees, in accessible formats. It is also imperative that those hosting remote training sessions ensure their digital platforms are accessible to all attendees.*
