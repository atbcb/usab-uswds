After graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy (USNA) in 2006, Brad spent seven years on active duty with the U.S. Navy as an explosive ordnance disposal officer. In 2011, Brad suffered complete vision loss as the result of a combat injury in Afghanistan. Within a year, however, Brad earned a spot on Team USA, and swam to gold in the London Paralympics.  Four years later, Brad won three more races at the Rio Games, notably sweeping the freestyle events and breaking a world record that had previously stood for over 30 years.  After Rio, Brad transitioned to triathlon, and became the first American male to win gold at either the Olympics or Paralympics.  All in, Brad has represented Team USA atop the podium 6 times, with two silver medals also to his name.

Brad is pursuing a Ph.D. in Public Policy with the intention of becoming a professor of ethical leadership. Brad also serves as an athlete representative on the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committeeâ€™s Board of Directors, and is the Vice chair for the Navy Special Operations Foundation.

For the life part of the work-life balance, Brad enjoys spending time with his wife and daughter, Sara and Rooney.
