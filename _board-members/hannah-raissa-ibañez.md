Hannah Raissa Ibañez, Esq., is a Deputy Public Defender II at the Los Angeles County Public Defender’s office; the first public defender agency in the United States. Prior to joining LACPD, she was a Senior Staff Attorney at Inner City Law Center in Skid Row, providing litigation defense to marginalized Angelenos seeking to either avoid or move out of homelessness.  Before moving to California, she was an Assistant Public Defender for Florida’s Sixth and Twelfth Judicial Districts, serving in both Misdemeanor and Felony divisions. She served on the board for the Red Tent Women’s Initiative, a Florida non-profit focused on providing resources that assist incarcerated women with their transition back into society. She developed a pro-bono clinic between the Sixth Judicial Circuit Public Defender’s office and her alma mater, Stetson Law school’s Social Justice Advocacy Program, to provide support to Public Defenders and their clients, while giving young lawyers the opportunity to consider a career in social rights advocacy. She attended Simmons University in Boston, MA for her undergraduate education.
