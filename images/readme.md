This directory contains images that are used in one or more places throughout the site.

## Filenames

As everywhere:
- Files _should_ be named with one or two words, with a hypen or underscore betweeen words.
- Filenames _should_ be shorter (rather than longer and more descriptive).
  - Keep in mind that context is also provided by the name of the parent folder.
- Image filenames _should_ reflect what the image is _of_, **not** what the image is _for_.
  - An example is `train-engine.jpg` _not_ `transportation.jpg`.

As elsewhere on the web:
- Filenames *must* be all lower case letters
  * Filenames on the web are case sensistive.  If mixed case is used, URLs not using the correct case might or might not open, and the results may vary depending on the operating system used by the end-user.
- Filenames _must_ **not** contain spaces nor other punctuation (except hyphens or underscores)
  * Best case is that spaces (and other punctuation) are encoded (fore example, %20 for a space) which makes URLs hard for humans to read.  As with mixed case, the operating system used by the end-user is a factor.

### USAB naming conventions

This remains a work-in-progress.

Board Members (and other portrait photographs)
: `lastname.jpg` for public board members and other people
: `last-i.jpg` (iff lastname is short or common)
: `lastname-xyz.jpg` for agency board member, and xyz is agency acronym

Smaller images (archetype examples):
: `org-logo.png`
: `xyz-seal.png` (where xyz is agency acronym, and image is presumably circular
: `something-badge.png` (stylized thumbnail, but see item below)
: `icon-something.png` (stylized thumbnail, but see item above)
: `word.png` (short graphical text)
