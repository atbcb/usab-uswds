This directory contains images that are used in one or more places throughout the site.

As elsewhere:
- Files _should_ be named with one or two words, with a hypen or underscore betweeen words.
- Filenames _should_ be shorter (rather than longer and more descriptive)
  - Keep in mind that context is also provided by the folder name
- Image filenames _should_ reflect what the image is _of_, **not** what the image is _for_
  - An example is `train-engine.jpg` _not_ `transportation.jpg`

As elsewhere:
- Filenames *must* all lower case letters
- Filename _must_ **not** contain spaces nor other punctuation (except hyphens or underscores)

Naming conventions (this is a work-in-progress):

Board Members (and other portrait photographs)
: `lastname.jpg` for public board members and other people
: `last-i.jpg` (iff lastname is short or common)
: `lastname-xyz.jpg` for agency board member, and xyz is agency acronym

Smaller images (archetype examples)
: `org-logo.png`
: `xyz-seal.png` (where xyz is agency acronym, and image is presumably circular
: `something-badge.png` (stylized thumbnail, but see item below)
: `icon-something.png` (stylized thumbnail, but see item above)
: `word.png` (short graphical text)
