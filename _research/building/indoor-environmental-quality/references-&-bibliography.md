"EMF reduction: The team reviewed available literature on EMF and their threat to health and determined that while EMF radiation could be measured, its threat to humans had not yet been proven or disproved. Nevertheless, the team recommended adopting a philosophy of prudent avoidance toward EMF risks and undertook modifications of the building design to reduce occupant exposure. EMF radiation can be mitigated by distance and by shielding. Distance offers maximum protection and is 'low-tech,' while the costs associated with shielding are high and the results are difficult to measure. Consequently, the design team chose to create 'buffer zones' to reduce prolonged exposures in portions of the building that are occupied for long periods of time, such as the laboratories and offices. The largest sources of EMF were identified as the building's transformers, the electrical rooms with their many cables, and the electrical conduit that was routed under the building atria. As a first step circulation and utility spaces were used to maximize the separation between a source and any potential receptors."

Ventilation rate to remove odors falls between 14-50 (l*s)/person or 28-100 cfm depending upon the type of odors to be removed. Ventilating to remove odor will exceed all requirements for Ventilation rates for human comfort.\
