Southwest General Health Center (SWGHC)\
Middleburg Heights, OH

POLICY 742\
Effective Date: July, 2002

POLICY NAME: Multiple Chemical Sensitivity Syndrome (MCS)

Policy

Southwest General Health Center will provide guidelines to ensure optimal care of the patient experiencing Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) which is mutually established with the patient, family/significant other and health care team.

1.  INTERPRETATION\
    Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS), also referred to as environmental illness or chemical injury is a medical condition in which individuals develop symptoms from exposure to very low level of chemicals in the environment. The interdisciplinary team at SWGHC uses a collaborative process with the patient, physician, family/significant other and the health care associates to establish a safe environment, to promote healing and ensure comfort.

    An organizational approach to patient management with multiple chemical sensitivities includes:
    -   Method to ensure patient is placed in a safe environment.
    -   Method to facilitate identification of a MCS patient.
    -   Method to verify competency of all associates providing direct and supportive care to the patient with MCS
    -   Method to ensure patient's participation in developing their care plan.
    -   Method to ensure patient/their families/significant others are educated about the need to communicate about any special care required.
3.  OVERSIGHT AND RESPONSIBILITY\

    -   Flag patient's chart clearly and boldly with MCS under the allergies.
    -   Flag patient's chart to notify all other health center departments in advance of treating the patient so proper precautions can be made for necessary equipment and special supplies.
    -   Indicate "MCS" on patient's allergy band.
-   Emergency Department:\
    Will assist health care center personnel in diminishing any unnecessary discomfort and possible risks when MCS patient is brought into the Emergency Room. The following is initiated:
    -   Immediately contact patient's physician for special instructions.
    -   Immediately isolate patient from all other patients and visitors.
    -   Place patient in an area which is not used to store any medical supplies or medications.
    -   Keep a supply of sterile linens and gowns in the emergency room area.
    -   Provide the least toxic pharmaceutical supplies and equipment.
    -   Coordinate with all other health center departments to meet patients' needs.
    -   Monitor the general environment the patient is placed in.
-   Patient's Room\
    Staff will implement numerous measures to prevent unnecessary exposure.

    Prior to patient's occupancy:

    -   Contact Environmental Services for terminal cleaning of the room.
    -   Place new sharps container in the room
    -   Contact CSS for sterile linen.

    During Patient's Occupancy:

    -   Patient should be isolated from other patients and their visitors at all times to prevent reactions to products these people are wearing or using.
    -   Place sign on patient's door stating: "Check at the nurses station before entering room".
    -   Keep patient's door closed at all times and if necessary provide a clean cloth to seal bottom of door from hall odors.
    -   Health care center personnel must wash their hands and apply hypo allergenic, non-latex gloves prior to entering the room of the MCS patient as these activities can trigger reactions in the patient.
    -   No live plants or flowers permitted in the patient's room (mold and pesticides trigger MCS reactions).
    -   No newspapers or treated paper permitted in patient's room. (3-part copy papers or chlorinated papers can be highly toxic and may affect breathing).

MULTIPLE CHEMICAL SENSITIVITY (MCS) PROTOCOL

| PURPOSE: | To outline the management and nursing responsibilities caring for a patient experiencing multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS). |
| LEVEL: | Independent |
| SUPPORTIVE DATA: | MCS is an acquired chronic disorder characterized by recurrent symptoms occurring in response to low levels of exposure to multiple unrelated chemicals.

Patient with a history of maladaptive reactions to chemicals found in perfumes pesticides, detergents, household cleaners, etc. may have or develop multiple chemical sensitivities. Approximately 75% of those affected are women, possibly due to endocrine disruption. People in their 30s and 40s are most strongly affected as well as children and others who are more susceptible to the effects of pesticides and products containing toxic chemicals. The population most strongly identified with this condition include: industrial workers, teachers, nurses, sick building occupants and those living in chemically contaminated communities.
