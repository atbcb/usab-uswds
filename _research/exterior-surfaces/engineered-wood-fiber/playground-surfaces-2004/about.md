### Acknowledgments
We gratefully acknowledge Bill Botten, U.S. Architectural and Transportation Compliance Board, for guidance in initiating Phase III of the development of the stabilized engineered wood fiber (EWF) concept and Ted Illjes and Bob Zeager of Zeager Bros. Inc., Middletown , Pennsylvania , for performing the impact tests.

Zeager Bros. Inc. and Beneficial Designs, Inc. (Minden, Nevada) , provided the apparatus for the impact test and the rotational penetrometer, as well as training in their use. Thanks to Zeager Bros. Inc. for the donation of EWF and Midwest Industrial Supply (Canton, Ohio) for the donation of Soil-Sement.

Our thanks to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for offering the park playground as a development site for this study. We particularly note the guidance and support of Anthonette Gilpatrick, ADA Coordinator, Renee Lee, Park Manager, and the staff of Governor Nelson State Park for installing and monitoring the playground site. Volunteer groups who helped to install the playground surfacing included the Rotary Club of Waunakee, Madison Chapter of Telephone Pioneers of America, and Edgewood High School students. We could not have performed the study without the support of Steve Schmieding of the Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) and his wife Jane as well as other FPL staff, namely Carl Syftestad, Lloyd Currier, Ben Henderson, Tim Voelker, Vicki Herian, Nancy Keen, Tom Kuster, and Mary Collet.
