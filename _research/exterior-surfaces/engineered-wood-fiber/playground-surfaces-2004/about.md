> Our thanks to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for offering the park playground as a development site for this study. We particularly note the guidance and support of Anthonette Gilpatrick, ADA Coordinator, Renee Lee, Park Manager, and the staff of Governor Nelson State Park for installing and monitoring the playground site. Volunteer groups who helped to install the playground surfacing included the Rotary Club of Waunakee, Madison Chapter of Telephone Pioneers of America, and Edgewood High School students. We could not have performed the study without the support of Steve Schmieding of the Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) and his wife Jane as well as other FPL staff, namely Carl Syftestad, Lloyd Currier, Ben Henderson, Tim Voelker, Vicki Herian, Nancy Keen, TomÂ Kuster, and Mary Collet.
