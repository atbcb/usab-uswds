**Abstract**

This report examines possible approaches to provide for both marine safety and disability access at doors into passenger accommodation spaces on U.S. passenger vessels. The Architecture and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board's ultimate objective is to assist designers and operators in improving wheelchair access without compromising the vessel safety provisions of the sills at these doorways. This report contains the results of "Phase 1" of the project, which are 1) to examine the application of the current governing safety regulations; and 2) to present several brief technical case studies examining the design and regulatory review of weathertight doors on K and T boats.
