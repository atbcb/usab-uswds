#### Installation notes

Wiring needs will vary depending on setup. Typically, a 3 wire 18 gauge -120 VAC derived from Walk and Don't Walk indicator is used. Some have concern over the 120 VAC and have modified the system.

Range of response to ambient sound is set by installer.

The speaker box is typically mounted to the signal pole or on top of the pedhead and wired to the WALK and DON'T WALK circuits, along with the common/ground terminal. The device broadcasts the WALK indication from the pedhead speaker. The black wire (provided) is connected to the WALK indication terminal in the pedhead and a white wire (provided) is connected to a neutral terminal in the pedhead. When current is sent from the controller to illuminate the visual WALK indication, the APS device is activated for the duration of the walk phase.

An innovative method of installing the speaker inside the pedhead has been developed by the City of Portland and McCain Traffic

The locator tone and vibrating arrow are an optional additional component of the device. A series of wires run from the pedhead unit to the push button to power the pushbutton speaker, and vibrating arrow. A current problem with Novax is the 120 VAC power that is sent to the pushbutton from the pedhead unit for the vibrating arrow feature. Some traffic engineers are concerned that this is excessive voltage and can be a safety problem if the pushbutton is removed or destroyed. Novax has been working on resolving the issues and developing other options with more typical voltage. This may have been resolved by the time this document is published.

#### Comments

Four pairs of 18-22 awg wires must run from the control unit to the Navigator pushbutton unit. Pedhead mounted control units or control cabinet control units are available.

One control unit for each device (push button unit). The control unit is installed in a typical 16-inch person/hand clam shell type pedestrian head and is powered from the WALK and DON'T WALK 120 VAC in the pedhead and converts voltage to 24 VDC (max.) to control the push button functions. There is no direct wiring application between the controller and the push button unit (it uses 14 awg pair that serves the pushbutton; however, four pair (minimum) or six pair (desirable) of 18-22 awg wires must be run from the push button unit to the corresponding pedestrian head. These wire pairs are connected to the "vibrator", "speaker", "pushbutton" and "LED" connections on the control panel. A Polara control unit and associated wire connections, is shown in Figure 4. Three 12 to 18 awg wires are also run from the control unit to the pedestrian head power terminals for the WALK, DON'T WALK, and "common" connections. This wire is the 115 VAC connections provided by the signal controller's load switch. One wire is also required to connect the microphone located on the bottom of the pedestrian head to the control unit.

For new/reconstructed intersections where new wire will be pulled, the control unit can be placed in the controller cabinet. The control unit consists of a shelf mount card rack power supply base station that can hold up to four control units. One control unit is required for each walk phase. A single microphone can be used to control the audible sounds for all control units, or each control unit can have its own microphone. Four pair of 18-22 awg wire are required to each push button unit.

The installer sets separate volume controls for Walk message and locator tone volumes. In addition, microphone sensitivity can be adjusted.

Pushbutton designed to install on pole with tactile arrow parallel to crosswalk. Care must be taken with placement on the pole to align the arrow correctly.

#### Comments

Manufacturer is developing a model that operates with only two wires to the pushbutton and is programmable after installation by a traffic engineer using a handheld PDA type device. The new model will have the capability to alternate signal sounds, to countdown pedestrian clearance interval and present a signal at the far end of the crosswalk only. It is expected to be available by fall 2003.

#### Installation notes

Pedestrian signal heads must be Relume LED heads. Speech message recorded in personal receiver is triggered by pulsed light from the Relume LED pedestrian signal display. The pedhead must be carefully positioned to transmit information only within the width of the crosswalk.

Relume devices are simply replacements LED pedheads with typical wiring. However, concerns have been raised about how to provide access to the information to pedestrians who are blind who do not have receivers and do not know where the Relume devices are located.

#### Comments

Speech message during Walk is not in language specified in MUTCD.

Device has an approximately 15 degree field to pick up signal.

Pedestrians who are blind must have access to receivers.

Pedestrians must know where the Relume pedheads are installed, or they are unlikely to search for or use the available information.

Without a locator tone, pedestrians who are blind or visually impaired may have difficulty locating and using the pushbutton.

### Talking Signs

**Type of APS**

Receiver-based

| ![Talking signs transmitter mounted on top of pedhead.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/research/interface-aps/report28.jpg) | ![Closeup of Talking Signs® receiver in left hand.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/research/interface-aps/report29.jpg) |
| Figure 26 (left): Talking signs receiver held in a hand; the receiver is approximately 6 inches long with a button on top which the pedestrians push to activate when scanning for messages | Figure 27 (right): Talking signs transmitter mounted on top of pedhead. |

#### Standard features

> #### Walk Indication

-   Highly directional speech message transmitted by remote infrared light, to handheld receiver---repeats "Walk sign" and the name of the street to be crossed

> #### Other

-   Wait message during Flashing Don't Walk or Don't Walk ---repeats "Wait" and the name of the street to be crossed.
-   Orientation message with wider transmitter range, available to pedestrians before they reach the intersection, provides street identification, signalization and/or directional information.

#### Optional features

Additional landmark information can be included in the orientation message, as this information is received before users reach the intersection, and it does not interfere wit their ability to hear or attend to traffic and signal information when they are at the crosswalk.

Developments in the technology and installation may include radio transmitted speech or vibratory information to alert travelers to locations where transmitters are installed. This technology, developed under the direction of the Japan National Police Agency, is compatible with the Smith-Kettlewell/Talking Signs® standard.

#### How Talking Signs works

![A bird's eye view of Talking Signs® infrared transmitter system for intersections.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/research/interface-aps/report30.gif)

Figure 28: A bird's eye view of Talking Signs® infrared transmitter system for intersections.

The above illustration shows how the Talking Signs infrared transmitter delivers messages to the pedestrian who is carrying a receiver.

Wide beam tells:

-   Direction of travel - "traveling east"
-   Present location - "on zero hundred block of Larkin"
-   Intersecting street - "towards Grove Street"

Narrow beam tells:

-   Crossing condition and intersecting street -
-   "Wait - Grove Street" or "Walk sign - Grove Street"
-   Safe crosswalk zone

#### Installation notes

The transmitter providing signal information must be carefully positioned to provide information only within the width of the crosswalk. Talking Signs has a control board mounted in the unit on the pedhead. The transmitters are wired by connecting one 110 VAC wire to the WALK, DON'T WALK, and common terminal in the pedhead. The current provided to operate the visual pedhead powers the Talking Signs transmitter. The pedestrian who is blind must have a receiver, point the receiver at the talking signs transmitter, and push the button to hear the message, 'Walk sign is on', or 'Wait', depending on the status of the walk indication.

#### Comments

Infinitely variable messages recorded in transmitters.

Receivers usable for many wayfinding tasks where transmitters are installed.

Pedestrians must know where the TS transmitters are installed, or they are unlikely to search for or use the available information.

Pedestrians who are blind must have access to receivers.

Infrared beams can be difficult to detect in some weather conditions.

#### Standard features

> #### Walk Indication - tones

-   Cuckoo - 0.6 seconds duration,Frequency Base 1,100 Hz ± 20%, Frequency Deviation +120 Hz ± 20%
-   chirp (peep-peep) - 0.2 seconds duration, Frequency Base 2,800 Hz ± 20%

> #### Other

-   Volume adjustment - self-switching to one of two output levels depending on ambient noise conditions

#### Optional features

> Not available

#### Installation notes

This devices broadcasts cuckoo/chirp from a speaker mounted on the pedhead and is wired into the pedhead in the appropriate direction. A small hole is drilled into the top of the pedhead or in the signal pole, and the device is connected. A black wire (provided) is connected to the WALK indication terminal in the pedhead and a white wire (provided) is connected to a neutral terminal in the pedhead. When current is sent from the controller to illuminate the WALK indication, the APS device is activated during the duration of the walk phase. This device has a PC board that plugs into the unit and is housed inside the APS unit to adjust the sound using two settings, initial volume with no traffic (volume) and volume level increase with traffic (feedback). Figure 30 shows the APS-10 control board.
