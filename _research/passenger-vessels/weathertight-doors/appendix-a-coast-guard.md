Stability Letter 16710/P002920, Ser H1-9603368, November 6, 1996

Master, FLYING CLOUD; O.N. 1047743
82’ 8” x 27’ 6” x 8’ 4” Catamaran Small Passenger Vessel (T-L)

You are responsible for maintaining this vessel in a satisfactory stability condition at all times and for following the instructions and precautions listed below.

A deadweight survey, witnessed by the U.S. Coast Guard, was conducted on the FLYING CLOUD, O.N. 1047743, at Somerset Massachusetts, on November 5, 1996. On the basis of that survey, and a conservative estimate of the vertical center of gravity, stability calculations have been performed. Results indicate that the stability of the FLYING CLOUD, as presently outfitted and equipped, is satisfactory for operation on Partially Protected Waters, provided that the following restrictions are observed.

DAMAGE SURVIVAL

When operated as indicated below, calculations indicate this vessel will stay upright (no more than 7 degrees of list under ideal conditions) after bottom damage, when the bottom damage is limited to any one major compartment in either hull, and not more than 1 foot 0-1/4 inches upward from the bottom of either hull. A major compartment is the total space between any two adjacent Main Transverse Watertight Bulkheads (MTWB’s). For this vessel, these MTWB’s are located at the following longitudinal locations forward of the transom in each hull: 7 feet 10 inches (frame 2), 30 feet 10 inches (frame 8), 46 feet 7 inches (frame 12), and 65 feet 10 inches (frame 17). Calculations further indicate this vessel will stay upright when damage is limited to both hulls (concurrently) forward of the collision bulkheads, which are located in frame 17 of each hull.

Calculations indicate this vessel will stay upright (no more than 7 degrees of list under ideal conditions) after side damage when the side damage is limited to any one major compartment in either hull and not more than 3 feet inboard from the side of either hull. To maintain the vessel upright after flooding (damage), the heeling forces imposed by wind, wave, and passenger movements must be minimized. The calculations do not specifically account for high winds, heavy seas, or the movement of many passengers to one side.

OPERATING RESTRICTIONS

1. ROUTE: Operation on Partially Protected Waters may be permitted. Since the vessel’s route is based upon other considerations in addition to stability, you are cautioned that the route may be further limited to that specified on the Certificate of Inspection.

2. PERSONNEL: A maximum of 153 persons may be carried on this two deck vessel, of which 149 may be passengers. Up to 100 persons may be carried on the uppermost passenger deck. Since personnel capacity is based upon other considerations in addition to stability, you are cautioned that the number of persons carried may be further limited to that specified on the Certificate of Inspection.

3. DRAFT AND TRIM: The vessel is limited to a maximum draft of 3 feet 10-1/2 inches above baseline. This corresponds to a minimum freeboard amidships measured from the top of the guard to the waterline of 5 feet 0-1/2 inches. Amidships is located 6-1/4 inches aft of frame 10. Trim shall be minimized.

4. WATERTIGHT BULKHEADS: There are no watertight doors in any MTWB’s. No watertight bulkheads shall be removed or altered without the authorization and supervision of the cognizant Office in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI).

5. HULL OPENINGS: Any openings that could allow water to enter into the hull or deckhouse should be kept closed when rough weather or sea conditions exist or are anticipated.

6. TANKS: Any cross-connections between port and starboard tank pairs shall be kept closed at all times when underway.

7. WEIGHT CHANGES: This stability letter has been issued based upon the following light ship parameters:

Displacement 42.91 Long Tons
VCG (Conservative Estimate) 10.60 Feet Above the Baseline
LCG 6.92 Feet Aft of Amidships

Any alteration resulting in a change in these parameters will invalidate this stability letter. No fixed ballast or other such weights shall be added, removed, altered and/or relocated without the authorization and supervision of the cognizant OCMI. The vessel is not fitted with permanent ballast.

8. BILGES: The vessel’s bilges and voids shall be kept pumped to minimum content at all times consistent with pollution prevention requirements.

9. SCUPPERS AND FREEING PORTS: Cockpit scuppers and deck freeing ports shall be maintained operable and completely unobstructed at all times.

10. LIST: You should make every effort to determine the cause of any list of the vessel before taking corrective action.

This stability letter shall be posted under glass or other suitable transparent material in the pilothouse of the vessel so that all pages are visible.
