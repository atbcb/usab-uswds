This guide explains requirements in the [ADA Standards]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/) for passenger loading zones.

### Required Compliance

[[§209]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-209)]

Where passenger loading zones are provided, at least one accessible
passenger loading zone is required in every continuous 100 linear feet
of loading zone or fraction thereof. Compliance is required only where
areas are specifically designed or designated for passenger loading,
such as those at airports, many hotels, and convention centers.

### Required Passenger Loading Zones

Accessible passenger loading zones must be provided at these facilities,
whether or not passenger loading zones are planned:

- licensed medical care and licensed long term care facilities where the period of stay exceeds 24 hours (located at an accessible entrance) (§209.3);
- parking facilities where valet parking service is provided (§209.4); and
- mechanical access parking garages (located at vehicle pick-up and drop-off areas) (§209.5)

### Accessible Passenger Loading Zones

[[§503]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-503)]

Requirements for accessible passenger loading zones address vehicle
pull-up spaces and access aisles, including their dimensions, surfacing,
and vertical clearance.

min. and 96" wide min. with an adjacent access aisle the full length of
the pull-up space and 60" wide min. Notes: Vehicle Pull-Up Space
(§503.2) The vehicle pull-up space must be at least 96" wide and at
least 20' long. Access Aisle (§503.3) A marked access aisle is required
next to, and at the same level as, the vehicle pull-up space. The access
aisle must be at least 60" wide, extend the full length of the vehicle
pull-up space, adjoin an accessible route, and cannot overlap vehicular
ways. The marking method and color is not specified. Surfaces (§503.4)
Vehicle pull-up spaces and access aisles must meet requirements for
ground and floor surfaces (§302) and cannot have changes in level other
than slopes not steeper than 1:48. Curb ramps cannot overlap access
aisles or vehicle pull-up spaces. Vertical Clearance (§503.5) A vertical
clearance of 114" is required at the vehicle pull-up space and access
aisle and along a vehicular route connecting them to a vehicle entrance
and exit. Accessible passenger loading zones are not required to be
identified by the International Symbol of Accessibility.

### Bus Loading Areas and On-Street Bus Stops

[[§209.2.2]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-209_2_2)]

Loading zones designed for buses that provide general or special
service, including charter service, to the public on a regular and
continuing basis are required to comply with provisions for bus boarding
and alighting areas (§810.2) in the transportation facility section of
the Standards. This includes bus service provided by public transit
agencies and other state or local government entities, excluding public
school transportation (referred to as "designated public transportation"
in ADA regulations issued by the Department of Transportation (DOT)). It
also applies to those serving tour, charter, and shuttle buses operated
by private entities (referred to as "specified public transportation" in
DOT's regulations). On-street bus stops also must comply with
requirements in §810.2 to the maximum extent practicable.

### Common Questions

![question mark]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}ques.jpg){: .float-right .thumbnail} 

#### Are accessible passenger loading zones required on sites where no passenger loading zone is intended?

Accessible passenger loading zones are required at these sites whether
or not passenger loading zones are planned: parking facilities that
provide valet parking, licensed medical care and long term care
facilities where the period of stay exceeds 24 hours, and mechanical
access parking garages. At all other facilities, the requirements apply
only where passenger loading zones are provided.

#### What constitutes a "passenger loading zone"?

Only those areas that are specifically designed or designated for
passenger loading are considered "passenger loading zones" under the
Standards. This includes those passenger drop-off or pick-up areas
commonly found at airports, convention centers, schools, and many hotel
entrances that have design features, signs, or markings indicating
passenger loading zones. At other locations, compliance is not required
even if passenger loading may occasionally occur, but is not
specifically intended or reflected in the design.

#### What distinguishes passenger loading zones from bus loading zones?

Requirements for passenger loading zones (§209.2.1) apply to any
passenger loading areas except those that exclusively serve buses
providing designated or specified public transportation as defined by
DOT's ADA regulations, including charter service, which are subject to
criteria for bus loading zones (§209.2.2) or on-street-bus stops
(§209.2.3). For example, at an airport, passenger drop-off and pick-up
areas serving cars, taxis, limousines, vans, and other vehicles are
treated as passenger loading zones, while stops exclusively serving
public transit buses, hotel buses, and other types of buses providing
designated or specified public transportation must meet criteria for bus
loading zones.

#### If a passenger loading area serves cars and vans, as well as buses, must the provisions for passenger loading zones and bus loading zones both be satisfied?

No, provisions for bus loading zones (§810.2) apply only to on-street
bus stops and those bus loading zones that exclusively serve designated
or specified public transportation vehicles. All other types of loading
zones for passengers must meet criteria for passenger loading zones
(§503). Where regular passenger loading zones are designed to serve
buses in addition to other types of vehicles not used to provide public
transportation, they remain subject to criteria in §503, although
applying the requirements for bus loading zones in §810.2 as well is
advisable, but not required.

#### Is a compliant passenger loading zone required where valet parking is provided?

An accessible passenger loading zone is required where parking
facilities provide valet parking services (§209.4). Also, an accessible
passenger loading zone is required where passenger loading zones are
provided and specifically designed or designated, such as many hotel
entrances, whether or not valet parking service is provided (§209.2.1).
If a site provides valet parking service but contains no parking
facilities (i.e., vehicles are parked on a different site), then a
compliant passenger loading zone is required only where a passenger
loading zone is provided. Here are several examples of how these
requirements apply:

-   if a parking garage (or other parking facility) provides valet
    parking service, an accessible passenger loading zone is required
    whether or not a passenger loading zone is planned;
-   if a restaurant or hotel provides a designed or designated passenger
    loading zone, an accessible passenger loading zone is required
    whether or not valet parking service is provided;
-   if a restaurant or hotel provides valet parking service but does not
    have a parking facility on the same site (i.e., vehicles are parked
    off site in a public garage or on public streets) and does not have
    a designed or designated passenger loading zone, then a compliant
    passenger loading zone is not required. (Note that policies and
    practices must be in place under the Department of Justice's ADA
    regulations so that the valet parking service accommodates people
    with disabilities).

#### Must the access aisle be flush with the pull-up space?

Yes, the access aisle at accessible passenger loading zones must be at
the same level as the vehicle pull-up space it serves.

#### Can curb ramps overlap access aisles?

No, access aisles, as well as vehicle pull-up spaces, cannot have
changes in level other than slopes not exceeding 1:48.

#### How are accessible passenger loading zone aisles to be marked?

The Standards require access aisles to be marked so as to discourage
parking in them, but they do not specify how markings are to be
provided. State or local codes and regulations may specify such
markings. Vehicle pull-up spaces are not required to be marked.

#### Are accessible passenger loading zones required to be labeled by the International Symbol of Accessibility?

No, accessible passenger loading zones are not required to be identified
by the International Symbol of Accessibility.
