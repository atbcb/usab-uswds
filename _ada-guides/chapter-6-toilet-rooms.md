This guide explains requirements in the [ADA Standards]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/) for
toilet rooms. 

{% include sr-dimension-markings.html %}

### Required Compliance

[[§213]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-213)]

Plumbing and building codes address the number and type of toilet rooms
and toilet fixtures required for a facility. The ADA Standards, on the
other hand, do not address the number of toilet rooms or fixtures
required for a facility, but instead specify which ones must be
accessible where provided. In new construction, access is required to
all toilet rooms, including those for employees. However, where single
user toilet rooms are clustered in one location, at least half for each
use must comply (§213.2., Ex. 4). In the case of single user portable
units, access is required to at least 5% at each cluster, excluding
those on construction sites for construction personnel which are fully
exempt (§213.2, Ex. 3, §203.2).

### Clustered Single User Toilet Rooms

Clustered single user toilet rooms (2 minimum) are those that are next
to, or close to, one another. No more than 50% for each use within a
cluster must comply. Compliant toilet rooms and portable units must be
labeled by the International Symbol of Accessibility unless all are
accessible (§213.2, Ex. 3, §216.8).

![Single-user restrooms along a corridor]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/toilet-rooms/2.png){: .img-large}

#### Unisex (Single-Use or Family) Toilet Rooms

[[§213.2]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-213_2)]

![Unisex restroom symbol]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/toilet-rooms/3.png){: .float-right .thumbnail}

Where multi-user toilet rooms are provided, accessible
unisex toilet rooms cannot serve as a substitute for access to
multi-user rooms, except in alterations where making multi-user rooms
comply is not technically feasible (§213.2, Ex. 1). Otherwise, where
multi-user and unisex restrooms are provided, both types must comply.
Providing an accessible unisex toilet room in addition to multi-user
toilet rooms is helpful for those who use personal care assistants of
the opposite sex. The International Building Code (IBC) requires
accessible unisex or \"family\" toilet rooms in assembly and mercantile
occupancies where a total of six or more toilet fixtures for each sex is
required (§1108.2.1 in the 2000 IBC and §1109.2.1 in later editions).
The ADA Standards require that unisex toilet rooms, where provided, have
privacy latches and contain at most one lavatory, one water closet, and
one urinal (or a second water closet) (§213.2.1).

#### Medical Care and Long-Term Care Facilities

[[§223.1]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-223_1)]

![medical care icon]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/toilet-rooms/4.png){: .float-right .thumbnail}

In licensed medical care and long-term care facilities,
toilet rooms that are part of accessible patient or resident sleeping
rooms, excluding critical or intensive care patient sleeping rooms, must
comply (§223.1, Ex., §805.4). The Standards cover independent
accessibility and do not address design for use that is assisted by
medical or resident care personnel. Features for assisted use that
conflict with the Standards can be provided in those toilet rooms
serving rooms not required to comply with the Standards. Otherwise any
departure from the Standards must be based on the provision for
"equivalent facilitation" (§103) which permits alternatives to
specified requirements that provide substantially equivalent or greater
accessibility and usability. This means that the alternative solution is
just as, if not more, effective than what is required by the Standards
in terms of accessibility, usability, convenience, and reliability for
people with disabilities. 

<div class="border padding-1" markdown="1" style="background-color: #e2e1ef;">
#### Toilet Room Location

The Standards specify the location of toilet rooms in two instances:

- Where toilet rooms are provided in multi-story facilities that are exempt from the requirement for vertical access between stories (§F206.2.3, Ex. 1 or 2), a toilet room must be provided on a story that is connected to an accessible entrance by an accessible route (§F213.1). Toilet rooms on other stories must fully comply as well.
- In alterations where it is technically infeasible to make men's and women's rooms comply, an accessible unisex toilet room is permitted as an alternative if it is located in the same area and on the same floor as the existing toilet rooms (§F213.2, Ex. 1).
</div>

#### Additions

[[§202.2]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-202_2)]

Additions are required to comply with requirements in the Standards for
new construction. Each toilet room of an addition must comply as would
be required in new construction.

#### Alterations

[[§202.3]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-202_3)]

When existing toilet rooms are altered, the Standards apply according to
the planned scope of work. If one toilet room on a floor is altered, the
Standards apply to that room only; if all toilet rooms on a floor are
altered, the Standards apply to each toilet room that would be required
to comply in new construction. The scope of work also determines which
technical requirements apply. If some, but not all, elements in a toilet
room are altered, only those elements altered must comply. If a room or
space is completely altered (or built new as part of an alteration), the
entire room or space must comply.

 ![Restroom with water closet and mirror above lavatory highlighted]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/toilet-rooms/5.jpg){: .img-large}

<div class="margin-left-8 margin-right-8 text-center" markdown="1">
_In a project involving alterations to the toilet, grab bars, faucet controls, and mirror in a restroom, the Standards apply to these elements but not to those that remain unaltered. In more extensive projects where additional elements are altered, application of the Standards is greater, commensurate with the scope of work._
</div>

{% include recommendation.html
text= "While only those elements altered are required to comply, it is advisable to maximize opportunities for accessibility in alterations. Alteration of multiple elements in a room or space may provide a cost-effective opportunity to make the entire room or space fully accessible."
%}

Compliance in an alteration is not required where it is \"technically
infeasible.\" The term is defined as \"something that has little
likelihood of being accomplished because existing structural conditions
would require removing or altering a load-bearing member that is an
essential part of the structural frame; or because other existing
physical or site constraints prohibit modification or addition of
elements, spaces, or features that are in full and strict compliance
with the minimum requirements.\" For example, combining two toilet
compartments to create an accessible compartment may be technically
infeasible where it would reduce the fixture count below the number
required by the applicable plumbing code.

When it is technically infeasible to make existing men\'s and women\'s
rooms comply, an accessible unisex toilet room can be provided instead
if it is in the same area and on the same floor as the existing toilet
rooms (§213.2, Ex. 1). Where technical infeasibility is encountered,
compliance is still required to the maximum extent feasible.

#### Alterations and Additions to Primary Function Areas

[[§202.4]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-202_4)]

When an area containing a primary function (a major activity intended
for a facility) is altered or added to a facility, an \"accessible path
of travel\" is required. The accessible path of travel, which must
extend from site arrival points to the primary function area, includes
provided restrooms (at least one for each sex or, if only unisex
restrooms are provided, at least one unisex restroom), telephones, and
drinking fountains, where provided, that serve the primary function
area. The accessible path of travel is required to the extent that it
does not cost more than 20% of the total cost of the work to the primary
function area. Compliance is required up to the point this cost cap is
reached, even where it does not result in a fully accessible path of
travel. See the [Alterations and Additions Guide](../chapter-2-alterations-and-additions).

#### Alterations to Qualified Historic Facilities

[[§202.5]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-202_5)]

![historic site]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/toilet-rooms/6.png){: .float-right .thumbnail}

The Standards provide certain exceptions for qualified historic
facilities where compliance in an alteration would threaten or destroy
the historic integrity or significance of a facility as determined by
the appropriate State Historic Preservation Official or Advisory Council
on Historic Preservation. One of these exceptions allows access to be
provided to a unisex toilet room or to one men\'s and one women\'s room
regardless of the number of toilet rooms altered or added (§213.2, Ex.
2).

<div class="border margin-left-8 margin-right-8 text-center" markdown="1" style="background-color: #e2e1ef;">
  This guide notes some provisions in the International Building Code (IBC) and the *ICC A117.1 Standards for Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities* that are not found in the ADA Standards. For example, the A117.1 standard, which provides technical provisions and is referenced by the IBC, requires a vertical grab bar at water closets. Not all differences between the ADA Standards and editions of the IBC and A117.1 standard are noted in this guide. 
</div>

###  Components of Accessible Single User Toilet Room

Requirements in the Standards for toilet rooms address doors, turning
space, plumbing fixtures, mirrors, dispensers, shelves, and other
elements provided.Other provisions in the Standards also apply.

![Single-user toilet room with elements noted: Water Closet (§213.3.2),
Toilet Paper Dispenser (§604.7), Lavatory (§213.3.4) where provided,
Mirror (§213.3.5) where provided, Coat Hooks and Shelves (§213.3.7) at
least 1 of each type where provided, Dispensers and Receptacles (§205)
where provided, Turning Space (§603.2.1) 60 inches diameter circle or
T-turn.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/toilet-rooms/7.png){: .img-large}

#### Urinals (§213.3.3)

{% include grid-2col-leftimg-righttext.html
img-file= "chapter6/toilet-rooms/8.png"
img-alt= "urinal"
text= "An accessible urinal is required only in toilet rooms where more than
one urinal is provided."
%}

### Water Closets

[[§213.3.2]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-213_3_2), [§604]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-604)]

Criteria for water closets address location, clearance, seats, grab
bars, flush controls, and dispensers. Water closets can be arranged for
either a left-hand or right-hand approach.

#### Location, Clearance, Seat Height and Flush Controls

text= "Locate flush valves and related plumbing to the side of the water closet or behind walls to keep the rear grab bar clear."
%}

#### Grab Bars

[[§604.5]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-604_5)]

Grab bars are required to be mounted on the walls beside and behind the
water closet. They can be separate or continuous. When returned to
walls, the length is measured to the centerline of the return,
consistent with industry practice. When attached at other points along
the bar, the length is measured to the end of the bar.

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="tablet:grid-col">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="tablet:grid-col">
      <span class="text-italic padding-top-8">The rear grab bar can be shifted to the open side of the water closet or split where it would conflict with the location of flush controls required by applicable codes (§604.5.2).</span>

location of flush control">
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Grab bars and wall or other surfaces adjacent to them must be free of
abrasive or sharp elements. Any projecting object must be located at
least 12&Prime; above grab bars and at least 1½&Prime; from the bottom and ends of
grab bars so that the reach and use of grab bars is not impeded.

#### Minimum Clearances at Grab Bars

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="tablet:grid-col">
      <img class="img-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/toilet-rooms/15.png" alt="Clearance at side grab bar shown to extend 12 inches minimum above the bar and 1 1/2 inches minimum from the ends and bottom of the bar">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Grab bars can have circular or non-circular cross-sections but must have
rounded edges. The 1½&Prime; clearance between the grab bar and wall is not a
minimum but an absolute dimension to prevent entrapment. Grab bars
cannot rotate within fittings. The structural strength of grab bars must
withstand a vertical or horizontal force of 250 lbs. at any point on the
grab bar, fastener, mounting device, or supporting structure.

#### Cross Section and Clearance

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

The Standards do not require or address additional folding or swing-away
grab bars on the open side of the water closet. However, if provided,
they must be mounted so that they do not interfere with use of the
required grab bars or the clear floor space at water closets. Also, it
is important they are properly secured (although this is not addressed
by the Standards).

<div class="border clearfix padding-1">

#### Toilet Paper Dispensers

[[§604.7]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-604_7)]

<div class="clearfix" markdown="1">
![toilet paper
dispenser]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/toilet-rooms/20.png){: .float-right .thumbnail}

Toilet paper dispensers must be within accessible reach
from the water closet. They can be located below or above (but not
behind) grab bars, though it is important that non-recessed dispensers
be outside the 12&Prime; minimum high clearance above the bar yet not exceed
the 48&Prime; maximum height (measured to the outlet) of the dispenser.
Dispensers must allow continuous paper flow and cannot control delivery.
</div>

<div class="clearfix padding-1" markdown="1">

{% include recommendation.html
text= "Recessed toilet paper dispensers provide better access by keeping space at the water closet clear. Large-roll dispensers can obstruct space at water closets and can be hard to reach due to their width and the required placement from the water closet measured to the dispenser centerline."
%}
</div>

#### Recessed Dispenser Location

![Recessed toilet paper dispenser location 15 inches to 48 inches above the floor
(measured to dispenser outlet) and dispenser centerline 7 inches to 9 inches beyond
leading edge of water closet]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/toilet-rooms/22.png){: .img-large}

#### Non-Recessed Dispenser Location

![Non-recessed toilet paper dispenser location 15 inches minimum high and 1

of water closet]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/toilet-rooms/23.png){: .img-large}

<div class="margin-left-8 margin-right-8 text-center" markdown="1">
_If the grab bar is 36&Prime; high, a non-recessed toilet paper dispenser
located above the bar must have an outlet at exactly 48&Prime; high to
accommodate both the maximum reach height and the 12&Prime; minimum clearance above
the grab bar._
</div>

### Example Single User Toilet Room

The Standards do not directly specify the size of toilet rooms which is
determined by a variety of factors, including the layout and number of
fixtures, the presence of other features, such as baby changing tables,
and even the swing of doors. How various space requirements are met also
determine the minimum room size, including required clearances at
fixtures and other elements, turning space, and door maneuvering
clearance.

Accessible toilet rooms can be configured in many different ways. The
layout shown here is used only as an example in illustrating the
features of a compliant toilet room. These designs show the minimum
dimensions specified in the Standards. Providing additional space in
toilet rooms will enhance usability.

#### Doors

[[§404]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-404)]

Maneuvering clearance is required at doors based on the approach and
swing. No elements can overlap door maneuvering clearances.

  </div>
</div>

Doors can swing into fixture clearances in single-user toilet rooms
where unobstructed wheelchair space is available beyond the door swing
(603.2.3). This provides space to enter the room and clear the door
using wheeled mobility aids.

#### Turning Space

[[§304]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-304)]

Turning space is required in the room and can be provided as a 60&Prime;
diameter circle or T-shaped space. Doors can swing into the turning
space. The orientation of the T-shaped space is not specified, and it
can be located for approach at any segment (i.e., the stem or either
arm).

  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="tablet:grid-col">

      <span class="grid-line text-italic">The location and orientation of the wheelchair space is not specified, but it should be easy to access upon entry into the room.</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Elements with knee and toe clearance can overlap a portion of the
turning space. With t-shaped space, overlap is limited to one segment of
the "T" so that the other two remain clear for approach and backing up.

#### Approximate Room Dimensions

typically determined by the width of the water closet clearance, the
lavatory fixture width, plus any additional lavatory clearance beyond
the fixture (unless the lavatory is recessed). Other elements provided,
such as a baby changing table, may increase this dimension._

![Toilet room with a water closet and an adjacent lavatory with a door
opposite the lavatory that swings in. The width of the room is based on:
the 60 inches minimum wide water closet clearance, the lavatory width, and half
the lavatory clearance width not overlapped by the lavatory (if it is
centered on the fixture).]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/toilet-rooms/36a.png){: .img-large}

_In the same example, if the door is opposite the plumbing wall and
swings in, the room depth will likely be determined by keeping the door
swing outside fixture clearances (left). Alternatively, if there is
unobstructed wheelchair space beyond the door swing, the door
maneuvering clearance and the horizontal depth of the lavatory may
determine the room depth (right). Turning space is typically available
in the room without further increase in room size where doors swing in._

![Figure: Toilet room with a water closet and an adjacent lavatory with
a door opposite the lavatory that swings in. The depth of the room is
based on the door swing clearing the water closet and lavatory
clearances. Figure: Toilet room with a water closet and an adjacent
lavatory with a door opposite the lavatory that swings in. Unobstructed
wheelchair space is provided beyond the swing of the door. The depth of
the room is based on the 60 inches depth of the door maneuvering clearance and
the horizontal depth of the lavatory which abuts, but does not overlap,
the door maneuvering
clearance.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/toilet-rooms/37.png){: .img-large}

_If the door swings out, the room depth is usually determined by the

design but providing additional depth will help minimize fixture overlap
of the turning space for improved access._

#### Example: Lavatory Opposite Water Closet

_Toilet rooms can be configured in many different ways, but the same
requirements apply, including those for fixtures, doors, and turning
space. This example shows a door swing located outside fixture
clearances (obviating the need for wheelchair space beyond the arc of
the door swing) and turning space free of any overlapping elements
(left). Fixtures and other elements can overlap turning space but not
the door maneuvering clearance (right)._

### Private Toilet Rooms Accessed through a Private Office

Single-occupant toilet rooms accessed only through a private office and
not for common or public use are permitted exceptions that allow certain
access features, such as grab bars, to be provided after construction as
needed. However, they still must be sized for accessibility and fully
meet all space requirements. Enlarging or reconfiguring a private toilet
room is not permitted by the Standards as a post-construction
accommodation.

#### Exceptions for Private Toilet Rooms

_Note: All other applicable requirements, including clearances and turning space, must be met._

### Water Closets in Residential Dwelling Units

In residential dwelling units required to be mobility accessible, at
least one bathroom must comply (§809.4). Accessible water closets in
dwelling units are permitted several exceptions that allow some
features, such as grab bars and knee and toe space below lavatories, to
be provided after construction as needed if certain conditions are met.
In addition, lavatories can overlap a portion of the water closet
clearance if additional clearance depth is provided.

### Water Closets and Toilet Compartments for Children's Use

[[§604.1]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-604_1)]

Specifications based on children\'s dimensions can be followed when
water closets and toilet compartments are designed primarily for use by
children ages 12 and younger. Structured as exceptions, these provisions
are optional and serve as alternatives to adult-based dimensions. Under
the Standards, the decision to design a toilet room for children is left
to other building requirements or regulations, good practice, client
preference, or other factors. When a toilet room or compartment is
designed for children, all pertinent alternate specifications for
toilets, compartments, grab bars, and dispensers must be applied.

{% include recommendation.html
text= "Where a toilet room serves both adults and children, provide one wheelchair accessible toilet for adults and a second one for children (only one toilet or compartment is required to be accessible in a toilet room). Unisex or \"family\" restrooms that are provided in addition to multi-user toilet rooms are beneficial to parents with children of the opposite sex."
%}

The Standards provide non-mandatory guidance on specifications according
to the age group served that reflect the differences in size, stature,
and reach ranges of children ages 3 through 12. The chosen
specifications should correspond to the primary user group and be
consistent within an age bracket. If the planned user group spans more
than one age group, one can select specifications that align on the
borderline between the two groups.

#### Water Closet for Children 12 and Younger

_Note: All other requirements for children\'s water closets and toilet
compartments are consistent with those based on adult dimensions._

The required size of compartments provides the minimum space needed to
enter, approach and transfer to water closets, and exit. As with water
closets generally, the only elements that can overlap the minimum
compartment/water closet clearance are: the water closet, associated
grab bars, dispensers, coat hooks, shelves, and sanitary napkin disposal
units. Other elements and fixtures, including baby changing tables in
the stowed position, cannot overlap this clearance. If an additional
plumbing fixture, such as a lavatory, is provided in a compartment, the
compartment must meet the requirements for single-user toilet rooms in
§603.

Toilet compartments are typically enclosed by partitions. Full-height
partitions and door assemblies are not prohibited but will require a
larger compartment because toe clearance below partitions is not
available.

{% include recommendation.html

Toilet compartments designed for use by children 12 and
younger must be slightly larger (59&Prime; wide for wall- or floor-mounted
water closets) because children\'s maneuvering skills are generally less
refined. The toe clearance must be at least 12&Prime; high to accommodate
footrests that are higher above the floor. As with adult-sized
compartments, additional space is required if toe clearance is not
available below partitions.
</div>

#### End-of-Row Toilet Compartment

Wheelchair accessible toilet compartments located at the end of the row
can provide more room by incorporating dead-end aisle space. The door
can swing in if it clears the minimum compartment area. The compartment
door can be located in the side partition that is closer to the water
closet when the door opening is beyond the minimum depth of the
compartment area.

#### Toilet Compartment with a Lavatory

[[§603]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-603)]

No other fixture besides the toilet can be located in the minimum space
required for the compartment. If a lavatory or another plumbing fixture
is located in a compartment, the compartment must meet requirements for
toilet rooms, including turning space. Another compliant lavatory is
required outside the compartment.

Ambulatory accessible toilet compartments provide parallel grab bars and
benefit people who use crutches, canes, walkers and similar devices or
who need support in sitting or standing. They do not accommodate
wheelchairs or scooters and are required in addition to the wheelchair
accessible compartment in toilet rooms with six or more toilet
compartments or where the combined total of toilets and urinals is six
or more. They are sized so that both grab bars are within reach. Grab
bars must meet specifications for size, location, and securement.

Seats cannot be sprung to return to lifted position. Requirements for
toilet paper dispensers, coat hooks, and shelves also apply.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/toilet-rooms/70.png){: .img-large}

### Urinals

[[§213.3.3]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-213_3_3)]

At least one urinal must comply where two or more urinals are provided
in a toilet room. Specifications address rim height, depth, flush
controls, and clear floor space. Accessible urinals must be either wall
hung or stall type. Flush controls must be automatic or, if hand
operated, compliant as operable parts and located within accessible
reach range (§309).

Clear floor space for a forward approach is required. Partitions or
privacy panels cannot obstruct or reduce the minimum clearance. If
partitions or panels obstruct both sides of the clear floor space for
more than 24&Prime;, the clear floor space must be at least 36&Prime; wide instead
of 30&Prime; wide.

![men's room sign]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/toilet-rooms/74.png){: .float-right .thumbnail}
![women's room sign]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/toilet-rooms/74b.png){: .float-right .thumbnail}

Where provided, signs that identify permanent rooms and spaces, including toilet rooms, must have raised characters and braille and meet criteria for visual access (§216.2). Visual content and tactile content can be provided on separate signs.

If pictograms are provided to identify toilet rooms (i.e., symbols for men's, women's, and unisex restrooms), they must be on a field at least 6&Prime; high, include the verbal equivalent below in raised characters and braille, and meet finish and contrast specifications (§703.6). These pictogram requirements do not apply to any informational pictograms that are also provided on the sign, including the International Symbol of Accessibility (ISA). If not all toilet rooms are accessible, those that comply must be labelled by the ISA. The ISA can be included on the toilet room sign or be provided separately.

![restroom sign with arrow and ISA]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/toilet-rooms/75.png){: .float-right .thumbnail}

Where existing toilet rooms in an alteration do not comply, signs with the ISA must be provided indicating the location of the nearest accessible toilet room, and those that comply must be labeled by the ISA as well (§216.8). The content of directional signs is not specified.

### Common Questions

![question mark]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}ques.jpg){: .float-right .thumbnail}

#### Toilet Rooms

##### Are toilet rooms that serve employees but not the public required to comply?

Yes. Public and common use toilet rooms, including those used
exclusively by employees, must comply. Private toilet rooms for a single
occupant accessed only through a private office are permitted limited
exceptions for certain access features, such as the later installation
of grab bars if walls have blocking or are reinforced.

##### Can access be provided to a unisex restroom instead of to men's and women's rooms?

If men's and women's rooms are provided, they must be accessible even
if a unisex toilet room is also provided. However, in alterations when
it is technically infeasible to make existing men's and women's rooms
comply, an accessible unisex toilet room can be provided instead if it
is located on the same floor and in the same area as the men's and women's rooms (§213.2, Ex. 1).

##### Is access required to a unisex family or gender-neutral toilet room that is provided in addition to accessible men's and women's rooms?

Yes. Unisex toilet rooms must be accessible, including where they are
provided in addition to multi-user toilet rooms. Where multiple
single-user toilet rooms are clustered at one location, no more than
half for each use are required to comply (§213.2, Ex. 4).

#### How does the exception for clustered single user toilet rooms of the same type (no more than 50% at each cluster) apply when there is an odd number of toilet rooms?

When there is an odd number of single user toilet rooms of the same type
in a cluster, the number of accessible toilet rooms can be rounded up or
down. Rounding up is recommended for better access and is otherwise
required when fractions or remainders result in determining the number
of facilities or elements required to comply (§104.2). However, rounding
down is permitted in this instance because the exception for clustered
single user toilet rooms states that "no more than 50 percent of the
single user toilet rooms for each use at each cluster shall be required
to comply" (§213.2, Ex. 4).

##### Is there a maximum distance or separation that applies to toilet rooms within the same cluster?

No maximum distance is specified, but clustered single user toilet rooms
are those that are next to, or close to, one another.

##### What is the impact of providing two unisex toilet rooms instead of a designated single-user men's room and a designated single-user women's room?

If two unisex restrooms of the same type are clustered in one location,
only one of the two is required to comply under the Standards (§213.2).
If a single-user men\'s room and a single-user women\'s room are
provided, both must comply even if clustered since they are different
types.

##### Can toilet rooms be designed for assisted instead of independent access?

The Standards address independent accessibility and do not contain
requirements for spaces and elements designed for assisted use. In
medical care facilities, features for assisted use that conflict with
the Standards can be provided in those toilet or bathing rooms serving
patient bedrooms that are not required to comply with the Standards.
Otherwise, any departure from the Standards, including those related to
assisted use, must be based on the provision for \"equivalent
facilitation\" (§103) which permits alternatives to specified
requirements that provide substantially equivalent or greater
accessibility and usability.

##### In facilities that are exempt from the requirement for vertical access between stories, are toilet rooms required to comply on stories not connected by an accessible route?

Yes. In facilities that are not required to provide an accessible route
between stories based on the story count or square footage per floor
(§206.2.3, Ex. 1 or 2), all other provisions in the Standards, including
those for toilet rooms, still apply to levels and stories not connected
by an accessible route. In addition, if a toilet room is provided on an
inaccessible story of such a facility, a toilet room also must be
provided on an accessible story so that it is connected to an accessible
entrance by an accessible route (§213.1).

##### What is the minimum size of toilet rooms?

The standards do not specify the minimum size of toilet rooms. The
required size of a toilet room is determined by room layout, the number
and configuration of fixtures provided, required clearances, the
presence of baby changing tables and other amenities, turning space,
door maneuvering clearances, and other factors and requirements.

##### Can doors swing into the turning space and fixture clearances?

Doors can swing into the turning space. They cannot swing into the
clearance required at plumbing fixtures, except in single user toilet
rooms where clear floor space 30&Prime; minimum by 48&Prime; minimum is provided
in the room beyond the arc of the door swing (§603.2.3, Ex. 2). In
addition, doors can swing into fixture clearances at single-occupant
toilet rooms accessed only through a private office and not for common
use if the swing of the door can be reversed (§603.2.3, Ex. 1).

##### When is a toilet room required to be designed for children?

The Standards do not require that toilet rooms be designed for children.
This determination is usually made based on other building requirements
or regulations, good practice, or client preference. However, the
Standards do provide alternate specifications based on children\'s
dimensions that can be followed where a toilet room is designed for
children.

##### If a restroom serves both adults and children, must an accessible toilet compartment be provided for both adults and children?

In restrooms that serve both adults and children, it is advisable, but
not required, to provide wheelchair accessible toilet compartments for
both user groups, but the Standards require only one wheelchair
accessible toilet compartment in all toilet rooms.

##### Can elements with knee and toe space overlap the required turning space?

Yes. Elements that provide compliant knee and toe space, such as
lavatories, can overlap a portion of the turning space.

##### Can elements with knee and toe space overlap the door maneuvering clearance?

{% include imgright-italictextbelow.html
img-file= "chapter6/toilet-rooms/76.png"
img-alt= "Door maneuvering clearance shown offset 8 inches maximum from the face of a door; a grab bar extends to a point near the latch side of the door and is within the 8 inch offset and does not overlap the door maneuvering clearance."
text= "Grab bars and other elements cannot overlap the door maneuvering clearance but can be located within the 8 inches maximum offset from the face of the door."
%}

No. Elements, including those providing knee and toe space, cannot
overlap or protrude into the maneuvering clearance required at doors and
doorways. However, door maneuvering clearances can be offset up to 8&Prime;
from the face of the door to accommodate wall thickness, casework,
shelves, or other elements adjacent to doorways, including grab bars.
The door maneuvering clearance must be measured from the leading edge of
such elements so that the full clearance is free of any obstruction.

##### Must toilet rooms be identified by the International Symbol of Accessibility (ISA)

Labeling accessible toilet rooms with the ISA is required only where
inaccessible toilet rooms are present. For example, half of single user
toilet rooms of the same type in each cluster (5% in the case of
portable units) are required to comply, and those that are accessible
must be identified by the ISA unless all are accessible (§213.2, Ex. 4,
§216.8). In alterations where existing toilet rooms do not comply,
directional signs with the ISA must be provided to indicate the location
of the nearest accessible toilet room which must be labeled by the ISA.

##### Do the Standards require restroom pictograms?

No. The ISA is the only pictogram the Standards require in labeling
toilet rooms. Other codes or regulations may require pictograms to
identify men\'s and women\'s rooms and unisex restrooms. The Standards
require that pictograms labeling permanent rooms and spaces, including
toilet rooms, be on a field at least 6&Prime; high and include the verbal
equivalent in raised characters and braille below the pictogram.
Informational pictograms, such as the ISA, are not subject to the
requirements for field height or verbal text.

##### Do the Standards require accessible toilet compartments, including the ambulatory accessible compartment, to be labeled by the ISA?

No. The Standards do not require toilet compartments to be identified by
the ISA.

#### Water Closets

##### Can an adjacent lavatory overlap the water closet clearance?

No. Lavatories are not permitted to overlap the 60&Prime; wide minimum space
at water closets, except in residential dwelling units if the water
closet clearance is 66&Prime; deep minimum (§604.3.2, Ex.). Lavatories (or other
plumbing fixtures) can be adjacent to the water closet if recessed so as
not to overlap the water closet clearance. (The rear grab bar can be
24&Prime; long in this instance if there is not sufficient wall space for a
36&Prime; grab bar.)

##### Can other elements overlap the water closet clearance?

The only elements beside the water closet that can overlap the water
closet clearance are: associated grab bars, dispensers, coat hooks,
shelves, and sanitary napkin disposal units (§604.3.2). No other
elements can overlap the water closet clearance.

##### Can the toilet paper dispenser be mounted above the side grab bar?

Toilet paper dispensers can be mounted above the side grab bar if they
do not protrude into the 12 inches high minimum clearance above the bar and
the outlet is within the maximum 48 inches height. With large roll
dispensers, ensuring that the outlet is within the height limit can be
difficult when mounted above bars unless they are recessed.

##### How is the distance from the water closet measured for toilet paper dispensers with large or multiple rolls?

The required distance of toilet paper dispensers from the front of the
water closet (7&Prime; to 9&Prime;) is measured to the centerline of the
dispenser, including large-roll and multiple-roll dispensers.

##### How can conflicts between the rear grab bar and the required location of flush controls be resolved?

If plumbing codes require a flush control location that conflicts with
the rear grab bar, the grab bar may be split or shifted to the open
side. This is permitted only where applicable codes mandate flush
controls in such a location.

##### Are automatic (motion sensor) flush controls required to be on the open side of the water closet?

No. Motion activated flush controls are not required to be on the open
side of the water closet. If a water closet has a manual flush control
in addition to a motion activated one, it is recommended, but not
required, that the manual control be located on the open side of the
water closet. Manual flush controls, even those intended for custodian
use, are helpful at water closets and urinals when the motion sensor
fails to activate.

##### Are flush controls located on valves, walls, or tanks that are centered on the fixture compliant (i.e., on the open side)?

Manual flush controls, including push buttons, must be usable from a
point between the centerline and the open side of the fixture. A portion
of the control can be outside the range if it is usable without having
to reach beyond the water closet centerline from the open side.

##### Can the side and rear grab bars be continuous?

Yes. The rear and side grab bar can be continuous or separate, but in
either case must comply with the specified length and placement.

##### Must the side and rear grab bar both be at the same height within the specified 33&Prime; to 36&Prime; range?

The Standards do not require both grab bars at the water closet to be at
the same height, although this is advisable. (Horizontal grab bars at
showers must be at the same height.)

##### Can the side grab bar be located on a half wall or wing wall?

Grab bars, if properly secured, can be mounted on a half wall or wing
wall where sufficient wall surface above the grab bar is available. Wall
surface above grab bars provides support and helps prevent arms from
slipping off the bar. Wall surface that extends the full height of the
required 12&Prime; clearance above grab bars, or preferably to the standard
adult shoulder height for standees, should provide sufficient support in
using grab bars.

##### Can the side grab bar be mounted on blocking when the centerline of the water closet exceeds the 18&Prime; maximum?

In new construction, the wall should be furred out so that the water
closet centerline is within the required 16&Prime; to 18&Prime; distance from the
side wall. In addressing access to existing water closets that are too
far from the side wall, the side grab bar can be mounted on blocking but
it is important that the blocking extend at least 12&Prime; above the grab
bar so that adequate wall support is available when using the grab bar.

##### Can grab bar attachments be located at points along the bar instead of at the ends?

Yes. Grab bar attachments can be at points other than the ends of grab
bars.

##### How is the length of grab bars measured?

Grab bar length is measured to the centerline of the return, consistent
with industry convention. This also applies to post-mounted grab bars.
When attached at points other than the ends (e.g., "European" style
grab bars), the length is measured to the end of the bar.

##### Can grab bars be mounted to the floor instead of the wall?

No. The Standards require grab bars at water closets on the side and
rear wall (§604.5). Grab bars that are floor-mounted obstruct usable
clear floor space at the water closet and may be difficult to secure.

##### Must grab bars have a peened or other textured surface?

No. The Standards do not require grab bars to have peened or textured
surfaces.

##### Are folding or swing-away grab bars permitted on the open side of water closets?

Folding or swing-away grab bars are not prohibited by the Standards so
long as they do not obstruct use of the required grab bars. It is
important that they are properly secured.

##### Is a vertical grab bar required by the Standards?

No. The ADA Standards do not require a vertical grab bar at water
closets. However, the ICC A117.1 standard, which is referenced by the
International Building Code, requires an 18&Prime; minimum vertical grab bar
on the side wall above the horizontal grab bar for people who are
ambulatory. This grab bar can be located within the 12&Prime; minimum
clearance required above the horizontal grab bar.

##### Can grab bars have infill plates to prevent suicide or security risks in detention and correctional facilities?

In detention and correctional facilities, grab bars must fully comply at
water closets serving accessible cells. Infill plates and other
anti-ligature measures may be provided in detention and correctional
facilities and other facilities so long as they do not impede gripping
surfaces. Grab bars are not required in those cells that are specially
designed without protrusions for suicide prevention (§604.5, Ex. 3).

#### Toilet Compartments

##### What distinguishes "toilet compartments" from single-user "toilet rooms"?

In some cases, it may be unclear whether water closets enclosed by full
height partitions are to be treated as toilet compartments or
single-user toilet rooms under the Standards. Toilet compartments can
have full-height partitions. The determination typically is based on
whether the toilet compartment is located within a restroom/ bathing
facility or if it is entered directly from a common use corridor or
exterior route. Those located within a room (such as a men\'s room,
women\'s room, or gender neutral multi-user restroom, locker room,
shower room) can be scoped as toilet compartments under the Standards:
at least one wheelchair accessible and, if six or more water
closets/urinals are provided, at least one ambulatory accessible
compartment (§213.3.1). Those that directly connect to, or are separated
by, a hallway, corridor, or exterior route, are scoped as single-user
toilet rooms: all must comply except that where clustered, 50% of each
use must comply (§213.2). If a toilet compartment contains more than one
plumbing fixture (e.g., a lavatory), it must comply as a toilet room
(§604.8).

##### Can compartment door openings be located more than 4&Prime; from the side partition when the compartment width exceeds the 60&Prime; minimum?

The Standards require the door opening to be located 4&Prime; maximum from
the side partition further from the water closet (or, if located in the
side partition, 4&Prime; maximum from the front partition). An increase above
the 4&Prime; maximum where compartments exceed the 60&Prime; minimum width may not
impact usability if the extra width of the compartment equals or exceeds
the increase above the 4&Prime; maximum (as permitted by the ICC A117.1
Standard), but such a departure must be based on the provision of
equivalent facilitation (§103).

##### Are toilet compartment doors prohibited from swinging into fixture clearances?

Yes. Toilet compartment doors, including those of inaccessible
compartments, cannot swing into clearances required at lavatories and
other plumbing fixtures. In addition, the compartment doors cannot swing
into the minimum required area of wheelchair accessible and ambulatory
accessible compartments.

##### Are spring hinges and gravity hinges on compartment doors considered "closers" in determining the size of maneuvering clearances?

No. Some approaches require additional maneuvering clearance when a door
or gate is equipped with a closer because of the additional force that
must be counteracted in proceeding through doors. Since spring and
gravity hinges do not significantly impact maneuvering at doors, they
are not \"closers\" for purposes of specifying door maneuvering
clearance.

##### Can accessible toilet compartments have full-height walls instead of partition panels?

Yes. But the minimum compartment size (both width and depth) is
increased more than 6&Prime; if minimum toe clearance is not provided below
the front partition and a side partition. Doors, including full door
assemblies, must be self-closing and meet all applicable requirements
for doors.

##### Can pilasters or other partition supports intrude into the required toe clearance below partitions?

Yes. Vertical supports for partitions are permitted within the required
toe clearance. The width of supports is not specified or limited by the
Standards.

#### Lavatories and Mirrors

##### Can a lavatory be located outside of a toilet room?

The Standards do not prohibit location of lavatories outside toilet
rooms where permitted by codes and other regulations.

##### Can a lavatory be provided in a wheelchair accessible toilet compartment?

Yes. But the toilet compartment must meet requirements for toilet rooms,
including turning space (§604.8). A second accessible lavatory must be
provided outside the compartment (§213.3.4).

##### Must the clear floor space at lavatories be centered?

It is advisable, though not required, that the clear floor space be
nominally centered on the fixture.

##### Can accessible mirrors be located above lavatories?

Accessible mirrors can be located above lavatories or countertops if the
bottom of the reflecting surface is 40&Prime; maximum above the finish floor
(§603.3). The bottom of the reflecting surface of mirrors not located
above lavatories or countertops must be 35&Prime; maximum above the finish
floor.

##### If a toilet room has a full-length mirror and a mirror above a countertop or lavatory, must both types comply?

No. The Standards require only one mirror in a toilet room to comply. If
mirrors are provided above lavatories or counters and at other locations
in a toilet room, it is advisable, but not required, that one of each
type comply.
