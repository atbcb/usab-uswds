This guide explains requirements in the [ADA
Standards]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/) for floor and ground
surfaces. Specifications for floor and ground surfaces address surface
characteristics, carpeting, openings, and changes in level. They apply
to:

- interior and exterior accessible routes, including walking surfaces,
    ramps, elevators, and lifts
- stairways that are part of a means of egress
- required clearances, including clear floor space, wheelchair seating
    spaces, turning space, and door maneuvering clearances
- accessible parking spaces, access aisles, and accessible passenger
    loading zones.

### Firmness, Stability, and Slip Resistance

[[§302.1]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-302_1)]

Accessible floor and ground surfaces must be stable, firm, and slip
resistant. Stable surfaces resist movement, while firm surfaces resist
deformation by applied forces. Accessible surfaces remain unchanged by
external forces, objects, or materials.

<div class="img-large-caption">Most loose materials, including gravel will not meet these requirements unless properly treated to provide sufficient surface integrity and resilience. Binders, consolidants, compaction, and grid forms may enable some of these materials to perform satisfactorily but require repeated maintenance.</div>

#### Slip Resistance

![slippery floor warning
symbol]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter3/3gf4.jpg){: .float-right .thumbnail}

Accessible surfaces must be slip resistant to minimize
hazards to people with disabilities, especially those who are ambulatory
or semi-ambulatory or who use canes, crutches, and other walking aids. However, the standards do not specify a minimum level of slip resistance
(coefficient of friction) because a consensus method for rating slip
resistance remains elusive. While different measurement devices and
protocols have been developed over the years for use in the laboratory
or the field, a widely accepted method has not emerged. Since rating
systems are unique to the test method, specific levels of slip
resistance can only be meaningfully specified according to a particular
measurement protocol. Some flooring products are labeled with a slip
resistance rating based on a laboratory test procedure.

Compliance with the standards requires specifying surface materials,
textures, or finishes that prevent or minimize slipperiness under the
conditions likely to be found on the surface. Standard practices for
minimizing floor or ground slipperiness will likely satisfy compliance
with the standards as slip resistance is important not just for
accessibility but for general safety as well. Applications and finishes
used to increase a surface material's slip resistance may require
continued maintenance or re-application.

#### Surface Smoothness

The standards limit changes in level and openings in floor and ground
surfaces, but they do not further address overall surface smoothness. Rough surfaces composed of cobblestones, Belgian blocks, and similar
materials can be difficult and sometimes painful to negotiate with
wheeled mobility aids due to the vibrations they cause.

<div class="img-large-caption">Cobblestones and other rough surfaces make wheelchair travel difficult and uncomfortable.</div>

text= "Avoid materials or construction methods that create bumpy and uneven surfaces in areas and along routes required to be accessible."

### Carpet

[[§302.2]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-302_2)]

Carpet that is thick, cushiony, or loose impairs accessibility,
particularly wheelchair maneuvering. The standards specify the maximum
pile height (1/2&Prime; measured to the backing, cushion, or pad) and texture
(level or textured loop, level cut pile, or level cut/uncut pile) and
require firm backing. Cushions or pads also must be firm or can be
avoided to ensure greater firmness.

![wheelchair rolling across carpet that is buckling]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter3/3gf6.jpg){: .img-large}
<div class="img-large-caption">Carpeting must be securely attached so that it does not shift or buckle against wheeled traffic. Cushions or pads, if used, also must be properly secured to resist movement. Rolling or buckling occurs when carpet is not properly secured and makes wheelchair maneuvering very difficult.</div>

Exposed edges must have trim on the entire length of the exposed edge
and be fastened to the floor to prevent curling. Trim must meet
specifications for changes in level, including requirements for beveled
edges when the height exceeds ¼ inch. The maximum height is ½ inch.

</div>

### Openings

[[§302.3]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-302_3)]

Openings in ground and floor surfaces, such as grates, are limited in
width to prevent passage of a ½&Prime; diameter sphere. Wheelchair casters
can get wedged into wider openings.

#### Surface Opening (Cross Section)

text-title= ""
text= "Elongated openings, like those of most grates, must be oriented so that the long dimension is perpendicular to the dominant travel direction.  In locations where there is no dominant flow pattern, openings must be limited to ½&Prime; in both dimensions.  Where an accessible route is available to bypass openings completely, they can be oriented in any direction."

### Changes in Level

[[§303]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-303)]

Changes in level can be up to ¼&Prime; without treatment or ½&Prime; if beveled with
a slope no steeper than 1:2. Changes in level above a ½&Prime; must be
treated as a ramp or curb ramp (or a walkway if a slope no steeper than
1:20 can be achieved). These specifications apply to all portions of
accessible routes, including thresholds and carpet trim.

### Common Questions

![question mark]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}ques.jpg){: .float-right .thumbnail}

#### Must accessible surfaces be paved?

Concrete, asphalt, and other paved surfaces are more reliably compliant,
but other materials, such as wood, and construction methods can be used
to provide firm and stable surfaces. Loose material like gravel will
not perform adequately unless it is sufficiently stabilized by binders,
compaction, or other treatments and will likely require repeated
maintenance.

#### What is the minimum level of slip resistance required by the standards?

The standards require ground and floor surfaces to be slip resistant,
but they do not specify a minimum level of slip resistance or
coefficient of friction. This value varies according to the measurement
method and protocols used. Some products are labeled with a rated
level, but in the absence of a consensus test procedure, the standards
do not set a minimum value. Standard methods to prevent or minimize
slipperiness in the specification of floor materials, textures,
applications, and finishes may be sufficient for compliance with the
standards.

#### Is there a minimum distance between changes in level?

The standards do not require a minimum horizontal separation between
changes in level of a ½&Prime; or less. Such level changes may need to be in
close proximity, such as at raised thresholds (otherwise a minimum 48&Prime;
separation will provide enough wheelchair space so that only one
vertical change is negotiated at a time).Ramps and curb ramps, which
must be used to span vertical changes greater than ½&Prime;, must have level
landings and clearances at the tops and bottoms of each run to provide
adequate separation and resting intervals between sloping surfaces.

#### Elongated surface openings must be perpendicular to the dominant direction of travel, but what if there is no dominant direction of travel?

When there is no dominant direction of cross traffic, openings must be
limited to ½&Prime; in both dimensions.Where space allows accessible routes
to completely bypass the area with openings, elongated openings can be
oriented in either direction.
