*![photo of man using wheelchair on golf
course](/images/guidelines_standards/Recreation_Facilities/Recreation_Facilities/golf-guide/2002_Conn_Amputee-Tom_Quin.jpg)\"Whenever
any barrier stands between you and the full rights and dignity of
citizenship, we must work to remove it, in the name of simple decency
and justice. The promise of the ADA\...has enabled people with
disabilities to enjoy much greater access to a wide range of affordable
travel, recreational opportunities and life-enriching services.\"*

> *President George W. Bush, New Freedom Initiative, February 1, 2001*

The recreation facility guidelines described in this guide focus on
newly designed or newly constructed and altered golf courses and driving
ranges. Other provisions contained in ADAAG address elements commonly
found at a golf course, such as accessible vehicle parking spaces,
exterior accessible routes, and toilet and bathing facilities. ADAAG
addresses only the built environment (structures and grounds). The
guidelines do not address operational issues. Questions regarding
operational issues should be directed to the Department of Justice,
1-800-514-0301 or 1-800-514-0383 (TTY).

Accessible routes are continuous, unobstructed paths connecting all
accessible elements and spaces of a building or facility on golf
courses. The accessible route must comply with ADAAG provisions for
location, width (minimum of 36 inches), passing space, head room,
surface, slope (maximum of 1:12 or 8.33%), changes in level, doors,
egress, and areas of rescue assistance, unless modified by specific
provisions outlined in this guide.

**Alternative Golf Car Passage**\
Providing an accessible route that complies with ADAAG may be
impractical throughout a golf course for several reasons. First, the
route of play for a golfer is dependent on where the ball lands and is
therefore unpredictable. The guidelines assume that on many courses,
golfers use a golf car to move throughout the course.

![illustration of accessible route or golf car
passage](/images/guidelines_standards/Recreation_Facilities/Recreation_Facilities/page-g6_low.jpg){width="206"
height="217"}Second, requiring an accessible route throughout a course
could alter the slopes within some courses and alter the nature of the
sport by eliminating some of the challenge of the game. Therefore, a
golf car passage may be substituted for an accessible route within the
boundary of a golf course. A golf car passage is a continuous passage on
which a motorized golf car can operate. While a golf car passage must be
usable by golf cars, it does not necessarily need to have a prepared
surface and may be part of a golf car path.

![illustration of golf car passage or accessible route on
fairway](/images/guidelines_standards/Recreation_Facilities/Recreation_Facilities/page-g7hi.jpg){width="228"
height="251"}The golf car passage could be located on areas such as
fairways, greens, and teeing surfaces. A golf car passage can be
substituted for all or part of the accessible route connecting elements
within the boundary of the course and must be a minimum of 48 inches in
width.

A golf car passage may also be substituted for an accessible route
outside the boundary of the golf course when connecting certain
elements. This is limited to the golf car rental area, bag drop areas,
practice putting greens, accessible practice teeing grounds, course
toilet rooms, and course weather shelters.

**Accessible Route Guidelines**\
Where an accessible route is used, the golf course guidelines modify
ADAAG's accessible route provisions. They increase the minimum width for
an accessible route from 36 inches to 48 inches. If an accessible route
is provided instead of a golf car passage, it must connect accessible
elements and spaces located within the boundary of a golf course. The
48-inch minimum width for the accessible route is necessary to ensure
passage of a golf car on the accessible route. This is important where
the accessible route is used to connect the golf car rental area, bag
drop areas, practice putting greens, accessible practice teeing grounds,
course toilet rooms, and course weather shelters. These are areas
outside the boundary of the golf course, but are areas where an
individual using an adapted golf car may travel. Where handrails are
provided along an accessible route, the guidelines increase the minimum
width of the route to 60 inches to accommodate the passage of a golf
car.

![illustration of course
barriers](/images/guidelines_standards/Recreation_Facilities/Recreation_Facilities/page-g7lo.jpg){width="192"
height="223"}**Course Barriers**\
Curbing or other man-made barriers often line golf car paths to restrict
golf cars from entering certain portions of the course or to reduce
erosion. Where man-made barriers are provided that prevent golf cars
from entering a fairway, openings at least 60 inches wide at intervals
not exceeding 75 yards must be provided. These dispersed openings will
provide access to the course at reasonable intervals, enabling a golfer
using a golf car to play the game without extended travel distances and
time requirements.

![illustration of teeing
ground](/images/guidelines_standards/Recreation_Facilities/Recreation_Facilities/golf-guide/page-8hi.jpg)The
\"teeing ground\" is the starting place for a hole of golf. A
rectangular area usually two club-lengths in depth, the teeing ground's
borders are defined by the outside limits of two "tee-markers." The
design and construction of new teeing grounds or the alteration of an
existing teeing area must allow golf cars to enter and exit within these
limits.

-   Forward Teeing Ground---The forward teeing ground for each hole must
    be connected by either an accessible route or a golf car passage.
    Existing courses do not have to provide access to the forward teeing
    ground in alterations, if terrain makes compliance infeasible.\
     

-   Multiple Teeing Grounds---If one or two teeing grounds are provided
    for a hole, only the forward teeing ground must be accessible either
    by an accessible route or a golf car passage. If three or more
    teeing grounds are provided for a hole, two teeing grounds must be
    accessible. This will allow persons with disabilities to play from
    different tees appropriate to their skill level, while providing
    flexibility to course operators and designers.

![illustration of putting

putting green must be designed and constructed so that a golf car can
enter and exit the green. The green must be connected by a golf car
passage so that a golf car can reach the green.

![illustration of weather

weather shelters must be designed and constructed to allow a golf car to
enter and exit, and have a clear floor or ground space of 60 inches by
96 inches minimum. This space will allow a golf car to be driven
directly into a weather shelter.

Both stand-alone driving ranges and driving ranges adjacent to a golf
course that provide teeing stations or practice teeing grounds must
comply with the following:

-   Accessible Routes---An accessible route or a golf car passage must
    connect accessible teeing stations with accessible parking spaces.
    The accessible route must be a minimum of 48 inches wide. If
    handrails are provided, the accessible route must be a minimum of 60
    inches wide. This will allow a person who plays golf from a golf car
    to practice driving a golf ball from the same position and stance
    used when playing the game.

-   Teeing Stations---If teeing stations or practice teeing grounds are
    provided, at least five percent, but not less than one, of the
    practice teeing grounds must be accessible and provide space for a
    golf car to enter and exit.![illustration of teeing

![photo of player in single rider adaptive golf car in sand
trap](/images/guidelines_standards/Recreation_Facilities/Recreation_Facilities/golf-guide/onthebeach-color.jpg)In
recent years, single rider adaptive golf cars have been used to increase
access for persons with disabilities on golf courses. Questions have
arisen concerning their use. The Access Board develops and maintains
accessibility guidelines for the built environment. It is outside the
jurisdiction of the Access Board to address operational issues such as
the use of these cars. Operators should contact the Department of
Justice at 1-800-514-0301 or 1-800-514-0383 (TTY) regarding issues
relating to the use and operation of adaptive golf cars.;

![illustration of accessible
bleachers](/images/guidelines_standards/Recreation_Facilities/Recreation_Facilities/golf-guide/page-11.jpg)ADAAG
also requires temporary facilities such as bleachers for tournaments,
assembly seating areas, portable toilet facilities, concessions, and all
other available amenities to provide access. Access to temporary
facilities on a golf course may be achieved through either an accessible
route or golf car passage. Facilities hosting tournaments or
competitions must comply with all the other requirements of the ADA,
including the general obligation to provide an equal opportunity to
individuals with disabilities to enjoy the services provided.

Accessibility Guidelines) as the basis of the requirements discussed.
 The recreational provisions of these guidelines were adopted into the
2010 ADA Standards without changes, so the ADAAG section numbers
correspond to the same section numbers in the ADA Standards (as well as
the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) Accessibility Standards).\
