This guide explains requirements in the current editions of the [ADA
Standards]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/) issued by the Department of Justice
(DOJ) and the Department of Transportation (DOT). It was developed by
the U.S. Access Board in cooperation with DOJ and DOT. It is important
to use this guide along with a complete copy of the ADA Standards as it
explains, but does not contain or reprint, the text of the ADA
Standards.

DOJ updated its [ADA
Standards](http://www.ada.gov/2010ADAstandards_index.htm) in 2010, which
are referred to as the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design. These
standards, which replace the original ADA Standards DOJ issued in 1991,
became mandatory for newly constructed and altered facilities as of
March 15, 2012. DOJ's ADA Standards apply to all facilities covered by
the ADA except public transit facilities.

DOT issued its current edition of the [ADA
Standards for Transportation Facilities]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/ada/ADAdotstandards.pdf) in 2006. These standards apply to facilities used by state and local
governments to provide public transportation. They became effective on
November 29, 2006 and replace earlier standards issued by DOT in 1991.

The current DOJ and DOT ADA Standards are very similar as both documents
are closely based on the Access Board's ADA Accessibility
Guidelines
(2004). This guide explains requirements of both standards, which are
jointly referred to as the "ADA Standards" or "the standards." Most
provisions of each standard are identical and discussed in this guide
without distinction. Both standards contain several unique provisions
not found in the other. In these limited areas, the guide notes the
differences and explains how they are to be applied. This guide does not
cover requirements of the original 1991 ADA Standards issued by DOJ or
DOT.

In addition to explaining the requirements of the standards, this guide
also provides clearly labeled recommendations for best practices that
exceed the minimum requirements and are thus optional to follow. In
addition, the guide provides links to other federal accessibility
requirements that may also apply to entities covered by the ADA.
