title: "Chapter 2: New Construction"
order-number: 2

file-description: PDF version of Chapter 2 New Construction Guide
---
This guide provides an introduction to the scoping
requirements that form the basis for the Department of Justice's [2010
ADA Standards](http://www.ada.gov/2010ADAstandards_index.htm) and the
Department of Transportation\'s [ADA
Standards](../../../transportation/facilities/ada-standards-for-transportation-facilities.html)
and is not intended to be comprehensive or used as a stand-alone
technical guide to those requirements. Users of this guide must
familiarize themselves with the specific scoping requirements that apply
to each element, building, facility, or site that is subject to the
Standards adopted to implement titles II and III of the ADA.

Although this guide focuses on the provisions of Chapter 2 of the ADA
Accessibility Guidelines, which form the basis of the DOJ and DOT [ADA
Standards](../ada-standards.html), the 2010 Standards adopted by DOJ
incorporate regulatory language that modifies or augments a number of
those provisions, or address certain occupancies that are not
specifically addressed in Chapter 2, and these regulatory provisions
must be read in conjunction with Chapter 2 to ensure an accurate
understanding of the legal requirements. Readers should become familiar
with how the 2010 Standards modify the requirements in Chapter 2 and
should not assume that by reading the provisions of Chapter 2 alone they
will have all the information and perspective they need to achieve
compliance with the 2010 Standards.

### Scoping Requirements

Requirements in Chapter 2 indicate which elements and spaces must be
accessible on a site or in a facility (the scope of coverage). These
"scoping" requirements apply technical provisions in Chapters 3 -- 10 to
those covered elements and spaces provided on a site.

Applicable building codes, design practices, and other factors determine
the elements and spaces required for a site, including parking, means of
egress, and plumbing fixtures. The ADA Standards, on the other hand,
specify the elements and spaces provided that must be accessible.

### []{#201}Application \[[§201](../ada-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#201%20Application)\]

The ADA Standards apply to the various types of facilities subject to
the ADA, from simple structures to complex, multi-building sites such as
university campuses and airports. Requirements in the standards apply to
both exterior and interior spaces and elements provided on a site,
usually without distinction. Provisions for parking, for example, apply
equally to exterior lots and to parking garages. The standards cover
permanent facilities and temporary facilities (other than those used in
construction), such as reviewing stands, stages, portable toilets, and
temporary classrooms.

In new construction, all areas must be fully accessible, including
multiple spaces of the same type, unless otherwise specified. Areas not
required to be fully accessible include:

-   certain limited-use or raised spaces that are exempt (§203)
-   employee work areas (partial access) (§203.9)
-   spaces covered by scoping provisions that require only a specified
    portion of the total number to comply, such as dressing rooms and
    patient bedrooms (various provisions in Chapter 2)

| the new construction requirements apply except where the responsible  |
| entity can demonstrate that it is structurally impracticable to meet  |
| those requirements. This exception is very narrow and should not be   |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The ADA Standards require a more limited level of accessibility in
employee work areas. At a minimum, areas used only by employees as work
areas must meet requirements for:

-   access to approach, enter, and exit the work area (§203.9)
-   accessible means of egress (§207.1)
-   wiring for visible alarms in areas served by audible alarms (§215.3)
-   accessible common use circulation paths in most work areas of at
    least 1,000 sq.ft. (§206.2.8)

Other requirements, including those for turning space, do not apply to
areas used only by employees for work.

These provisions apply to those areas where only work is performed by
employees. Spaces not used for work, including employee restrooms,
locker rooms, break rooms, cafeterias, and parking, must be fully
accessible. Some public use spaces also function as work spaces, such as
medical exam rooms and classrooms. These spaces must be fully accessible
for public use, but elements within used only by employees for work are
not required to comply.

**Access to Approach, Enter, and Exit Work Areas**

Access for "approach, entry, and exit" requires a connecting accessible
route to the work area and a compliant entrance, including entry doors
or gates, plus wheelchair space in the work area. Work areas must also
be served by an accessible means of egress, as required by the
International Building Code.

**Access for Approach, Entry, and Exit**

 \
**Common Use Circulation Paths in Employee Work Areas
\[[§206.2.8](../ada-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#206%20Accessible%20Routes)\]**

Common use circulation paths must be accessible in work areas 1,000
square feet or more in size (as defined by permanently installed
partitions, counters, casework, or furnishings). This requirement
facilitates access to individual work stations within a space.

**Common Use Circulation Paths**

![Common use circulation paths shown in employee work area greater than
1,000 square feet containing approximately 20 cubicles. Figure notes:
Common use circulation paths in work areas of 1,000 sq. ft. or more must
meet requirements for accessible routes, including clear width and
changes in level. Doors and gates that are part of common use
circulation paths, including those leading to and from the work area,
must fully
comply.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ada-aba/guides/chapter2-ada/nc17.jpg)\
 \
**Work Area Circulation Paths: Exceptions**

Common use circulation paths are required to be accessible except:

-   in work areas below 1,000 sq. ft. in size
-   in work areas fully exposed to the weather (regardless of size)
-   where they are integral to work equipment

![Large tanks with stairs leading to catwalk on top. Figure note:
Circulation paths integrated into storage tanks, machinery, and other
work equipment are not required to comply. Technical exceptions also
allow circulation path clearances to be reduced where it is essential to
the work function (§403.5, §405.5) and permit later installation of ramp
handrails
(§405.8).]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ada-aba/guides/chapter2-ada/nc18.jpg)

**Circulation Paths Serving Exempted Spaces \[§203\]**

Portions of common use circulation paths serving exempt spaces within a
work area are not required to comply, including routes to or within:

-   machinery spaces used only by service personnel; 
-   spaces accessed only by ladders, catwalks, crawl spaces, or very
    narrow passageways;
-   employee work areas under 300 sq. ft. that are elevated at least 7"
    as an essential functional condition of the space (excluding raised
    courtroom stations);
-   and other exempted spaces.

\[[§215.3](../ada-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#215%20Fire%20Alarm%20Systems)\]**

All employee work areas served by audible fire alarms, regardless of
size, must be designed to support later installation of visible alarms
after construction if needed. In new construction, alarm systems are
typically provided with sufficient power resources to support the
addition of strobes where they are needed to accommodate an employee who
cannot hear the audible alarm.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![design compass]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ada-aba/guides/compass.jpg){width="35" height="63"}*Recommendation:*  In facilities where an above-average number of employees with hearing impairments is likely, such as in the offices of a school for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, it is advisable to equip alarm systems with power capacity above the level that is typically provided in order to accommodate a greater number of visual appliances.

\
Scoping provisions for elements and spaces, which are summarized here,
are further discussed with relevant technical provisions in the
following chapters of this guide.

### **Site Arrival Points, Entrances, and Egress** {#site-arrival-points-entrances-and-egress style="text-align: center;"}

![Figure of entrance at food mart with accessible parking spaces and
accessible routes shown extending from entrance to access aisle at
parking spaces and continuing down front sidewalk. Figure notes:
Entrances (§206.4) At least 60% of all public entrances must be
accessible, in addition to entrances serving parking structures, tunnels
or elevated walkways, tenant spaces, or those entrances that are
restricted. Accessible Routes (§206) An accessible route to accessible
entrances is required from public streets and sidewalks (unless site
arrival is by vehicle only), parking, passenger loading zones, and
transportation stops provided within the boundary of the site.
Accessible Means of Egress (§207) Accessible means of egress must be
provided as required by the International Building Code (2000 edition
with 2001 supplement or 2003 edition). Parking (§208) The minimum number
of accessible spaces is based on the total number of spaces provided in
each parking lot or garage. At least 1 of every 6 accessible spaces must
be van accessible. Passenger Loading Zones and Bus Stops (§209) Where
passenger loading zones are provided, an accessible loading zone is
required in every continuous 100 linear feet or fraction thereof. Bus
stops and bus loading zones for designated or specified public
transportation, where provided, must meet requirements for bus boarding
and alighting
areas.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ada-aba/guides/chapter2-ada/nc20.jpg)\
 

### **General Elements** {#general-elements style="text-align: center;"}

Most scoping provisions apply to both interior and exterior elements
where provided throughout facilities and sites (and are not limited to
those in corridors as shown here).

![Figure of corridor with a door, elevator, light sconce (protruding
object), outlet and fire extinguisher cabinet (operable parts). Figure
notes: Accessible Routes (§206) and Doors (§206.5) An accessible route
must connect all accessible spaces and elements in a facility, and doors
on accessible routes must comply Protruding Objects (§204) Objects on
all circulation paths (not just accessible routes) must be installed so
that they do not pose hazards to people with vision impairments.
Operable Parts (§205) Controls, outlets, receptacles, and other operable
parts are covered (excluding those used only by maintenance personnel or
serving a dedicated use).. Elevators (§206.6) Vertical access between
stories is required in most multi-story facilities. Stairways (§210) All
stairs that are part of a required means of egress must comply. Windows
(§229) If windows are provided in accessible spaces for operation by
occupants, at least 1 must comply. Each window that is required to be
operable by a local code or authority also must comply. These
requirements do not apply to residential
facilities.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ada-aba/guides/chapter2-ada/nc21.jpg)

 

### **Communication Elements** {#communication-elements style="text-align: center;"}

 

![Figure of corridor with overhead sign ("East Wing Rooms 300 -- 350"),
sign at door, fire alarm, and pay telephone. Figure notes: Fire Alarm
Systems (§215) Fire alarms, if provided, must comply with the National
Fire Alarm Code (NFPA 72) which covers audible and visual features.
Signs (§216) Directional and informational signs, where provided, must
meet requirements for visual access, and signs identifying permanent
spaces, room numbers/ names, floor levels, and exits must also have
raised characters and braille. The International Symbol of Accessibility
is used to identify accessible entrances, restrooms, and bathing
facilities (unless all are accessible), as well as to label accessible
parking spaces, and check-out aisles. Symbols are also specified for
signs indicating assistive listening systems and TTYs. Telephones (§217)
All public telephones must have volume control and wheelchair access is
required to at least 1 public phone of each type (e.g., pay, closed
circuit, courtesy, etc.) provided on a floor/level or exterior site (or
at each bank if more than 1 bank is provided on a floor). TTYs are
required based on the number of pay telephones provided. Assistive
Listening Systems (§219) Assistive listening systems for people who are
hard of hearing are required in all assembly areas equipped with audio
amplification and all courtrooms. Two-way Communication Systems (§230)
Two-way communication systems provided to gain admittance to buildings

### []{#questions}Common Questions

*Are all public use and common use areas required to be accessible?*

All areas of facilities, including public and common use areas, are
required to be accessible in new construction except those that are
specifically exempt (e.g., certain types of limited use or raised
spaces) or that are covered by provisions that require only a specified
portion to comply (e.g., transient lodging guest rooms and patient
bedrooms). All other rooms and spaces, including multiple ones of the
same type, such as patient exam rooms, classrooms, and courtrooms, are
required to be accessible. Employee work areas, however, are not
required to be fully accessible.

*Can access be provided after construction based on need?*

Access required by the ADA Standards must be put in place and ready for
use as part of construction. This is required in all but a few specified
instances, such as:

-   Toilet and bathrooms in residential dwelling units or accessed
    through an individual's private office for his or her exclusive use
    are not required to be built with certain specifically enumerated
    access features, such as grab bars and lavatory clearances, if they
    are built according to criteria that will facilitate later
    installation or adaptation, such as reinforcement for grab bars and
    removable vanity cabinets.
-   Vertical access to work stations in courtrooms, such as judges'
    benches, can be provided after construction if space and other
    requirements are met to ease later installation of necessary ramps
    or lifts.

*Are employee restrooms and break rooms required to be accessible?*

Yes, spaces used by employees for purposes other than work, including
restrooms, break rooms, locker rooms, lounges, and parking must be fully
accessible. Areas used only by employees for work are not required to be
fully accessible but must be connected by accessible routes and means of
egress for approach, entry, and exit and have wiring to support visual
alarms if served by audible alarms. Also, circulation paths must be
accessible in work areas at least 1,000 square feet in size.

*What does access for "approach, entry, and exit" to employee work areas
require?*

Access for individuals with disabilities to "approach, entry, and exit"
employee work areas requires that the following be provided at a
minimum: an accessible route to the work area, a compliant entrance,
including any entry door or gate, to the work area, and wheelchair space
(30 inches by 48 inches minimum) within the work area. Work areas also
must also meet referenced requirements in the International Building
Code for accessible means of egress and also have wiring to support
later installation of visual alarm appliances.
