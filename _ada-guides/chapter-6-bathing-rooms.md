This guide explains requirements in the [ADA Standards]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/) for bathing rooms. 

### Required Compliance 

[[§213]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-213)]

Plumbing and building codes address the number and type of bathing rooms
and fixtures required for a facility. The ADA Standards, on the other
hand, address access to bathing rooms where they are provided. In new
construction, access is required to all bathing rooms, including those
for employees. However, where single user portable units are provided,
at least 5% at each cluster must comply and be labelled by the
International Symbol of Accessibility (ISA) unless all in a cluster are
accessible (§213.2. Ex. 3, §216.8).

![Bathroom with toilet, roll-in-shower, and lavatory]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/2.png){: .img-large}

#### Unisex Bathing Rooms

[[§213.2]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-213_2)]

![Unisex restroom symbol]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/toilet-rooms/3.png){: .float-right .thumbnail}

Where multi-user bathing rooms are provided, accessible
unisex bathing rooms cannot serve as a substitute for compliant
multi-user rooms, except in alterations where making multi-user rooms
comply is not technically feasible (§213.2, Ex. 1). Otherwise, where
multi-user and unisex bathing rooms are provided, both types must
comply. Unisex bathing rooms, where provided, must have privacy latches
and contain a shower or shower and tub, a lavatory, and a water closet
(§213.2.1). Providing an accessible unisex bathing room in addition to
accessible multi-user bathing rooms is helpful for those who use
personal care assistants of the opposite sex. The International Building
Code requires accessible unisex bathing rooms in recreational facilities
with separate-sex bathing rooms that have more than one shower or
bathtub fixture (§1108.2.1 in the 2000 IBC and §1109.2.1 in later
editions).

#### Additions

[[§202.2]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-202_2)]

Additions are required to comply with requirements in the Standards for
new construction. Each bathing room of an addition must comply as would
be required in new construction. 

#### Alterations

[[§202.3]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-202_3)]

When existing bathing rooms are altered, the Standards apply according
to the planned scope of work. If one bathing room on a floor is altered,
the Standards apply to that room only; if all bathing rooms on a floor
are altered, the Standards apply to each bathing room that would be
required to comply in new construction. The scope of work also
determines which technical requirements apply. If some, but not all,
elements in a bathing room are altered, only those elements altered must
comply. If a room or space is completely altered (or built new as part
of an alteration), the entire room or space must comply.

{% include recommendation.html
text= "While only those elements altered are required to comply, it is advisable to maximize opportunities for accessibility in alterations. Alteration of multiple elements in a room or space may provide a cost-effective opportunity to make the entire room or space fully accessible."
%}

Compliance in an alteration is not required where it is \"technically
infeasible.\" The term is defined as \"something that has little
likelihood of being accomplished because existing structural conditions
would require removing or altering a load-bearing member that is an
essential part of the structural frame; or because other existing
physical or site constraints prohibit modification or addition of
elements, spaces, or features that are in full and strict compliance
with the minimum requirements.\" When it is technically infeasible to
make existing men\'s and women\'s bathing rooms comply, an accessible
unisex bathing room can be provided instead if it is in the same area
and on the same floor as the existing bathing rooms (§213.2, Ex. 1). If
technical infeasibility is encountered, compliance is still required to
the maximum extent feasible. Where existing bathing rooms in an
alteration do not comply, signs with the International Symbol of
Accessibility (ISA) must be provided indicating the location of the
nearest accessible bathing room. Those that comply must be labeled by
the ISA (§216.8).

<div class="border padding-left-1 padding-right-1" style="background-color: #e2e1ef;" markdown="1">
#### Bathing Room Location

The Standards do not generally require bathing rooms to be provided in a specific location. However, in multi-story facilities that are exempt from the requirement for vertical access between stories based on the story count or square footage per floor (§206.2.3, Ex. 1 or 2), if a bathing room is provided on an inaccessible story, a bathing room also must be provided on an accessible story so that it is connected to an accessible entrance by an accessible route (§213.1). Bathing rooms provided on other stories must fully comply as well.
</div>

### Bathing Fixtures

[[§213.3]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-213_3)]

Bathing facilities must have at least one compliant shower compartment
or bathtub. In transient lodging guest rooms, a portion of accessible
guest rooms must have a roll-in shower with a folding seat (§224.2).

#### Components of an Accessible Bathing Facility

<div class="text-center text-italic padding-left-3 padding-right-3">
Requirements in the Standards address doors, turning space, plumbing fixtures, mirrors, dispensers, shelves, and other elements provided. Other provisions in the Standards also apply.

provided, Dispensers and Receptacles (§205) where provided, Coat Hooks
and Shelves (§213.3.7) at least 1 of each type where provided, Turning
Space (§603.2.1) 60]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/3.jpg){: .img-large}

#### Urinals (§213.3.3)

{% include grid-2col-leftimg-righttext.html
img-file= "chapter6/toilet-rooms/8.png"
img-alt= "urinal"
text= "An accessible urinal is required only in toilet rooms where more than
one urinal is provided."
%}

### Roll-In Shower Compartments

[[§608]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-608)]

Roll-in shower compartments provide access for shower chairs and other
wheeled mobility aids without the need to transfer to a seat. The
Standards provide specifications for a standard type and an alternate
type of roll-in compartment.

A seat can be provided in roll-in showers (and is required in those
roll-in showers that must be provided to serve a portion of accessible
transient lodging guest rooms). If a seat is provided, it must be
folding so that it does not impede use with a shower chair or other
wheeled mobility aid.

#### Standard Roll-In Shower Compartment

![standard roll-in

{% include recommendation.html
text= "Providing a folding seat in roll-in shower compartments offers greater usability by allowing transfer options. The ICC ANSI A117.1 Standard, which is referenced by the International Building Code, requires a folding seat in each roll-in shower compartment."
%} 

#### Size and Clearance

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="tablet:grid-col">
       <p>The compartment size and the required clearance adjacent to the open face of the compartment permit maneuvering into the shower with shower chairs or wheelchairs. The clearance must abut, or be close to, the shower entry but may be slightly forward of the shower to accomodate tile edges or flanges around the face of prefabricated showers.</p>
      <p class="text-italic">Note: Dimensions measured to the center point (vertical and horizontal) of opposing walls. A compliant lavatory can overlap one end of the clearance but cannot be adjacent to controls (or a folding seat).</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

#### Grab Bars

Grab bars are required on three walls in standard compartments without a
seat. Grab bars can be continuous or separate. If separate, they must be
6" maximum from adjacent walls and each must be at the same height
above the finish floor. The grab bars must extend across the side wall
to the entry. A maximum distance of the grab bar from the shower entry
is not specified, but they are to be installed near the entry.

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

#### Controls and Enclosures

In a standard roll-in compartment without a seat, the controls, faucet,
and shower spray unit can be located on any of the three walls. They
must be located above grab bars and within accessible reach range.
Shower controls and fittings must be at least 1½\" above the grab bar so
that they do not impede the bar\'s gripping surface. Enclosures cannot
obstruct controls, faucets, shower spray units or transfer to seats.

![Shower controls, faucet, and shower spray unit can be placed on any of
the 3 walls above the grab bar and below a 48\" max. height. Detail
showing control location 1½" min. above grab
bar]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/9-10a.png){: .img-large}

#### Thresholds

Thresholds at roll-in showers must comply with specifications for
changes in level to allow access to wheeled mobility aids. While a
threshold height up to ½\" (if properly beveled) is permitted, trench
drains and other designs that allow a flush transition to the shower
floor will provide easier access. Shower floors can slope to drains (a
1:48 maximum slope will help control water without impacting
accessibility). Where floor drains are provided in bathing rooms, it is
important that the slope of the floor not exceed the 1:48 minimum cross
slope.

![Figure: beveled curb at shower; Detail of beveled curb profile showing
a vertical change in level up to a height 1/4\" max. and a change in
level between 1/4\" and 1/2\" max. beveled 1:2 Figure: trench drain at
shower]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/11.png){: .img-large}

#### Standard Roll-In Shower Compartment with Folding Seat

Equipping roll-in showers with folding seats enhances usability by
providing a transfer option. This is helpful since many wheeled mobility
aids are not usable in showers. If provided, the seat must be folding,
attached to the wall, and extend to within 3\" of the entry. In standard
compartments, it must be located on a side wall. The controls, faucet,
and hand-held shower spray unit are required to be on the back wall as
specified so that they are usable from the seat. Grab bars cannot
overlap the seat and are required on the side opposite the seat and on
the back wall to the front edge of the seat.

{% include recommendation.html
text= "Provide folding seats in all roll-in showers for better access. Soap dispensers and shelves, where provided in roll-in showers, should be within reach from the seat."
%}

<div class="text-center text-italic padding-left-5 padding-right-5">
A compliant lavatory can overlap the clearance on the side further from
the seat (locating it on the seat side would obstruct transfer). In a
compartment without a seat, it cannot overlap the side of the clearance
adjacent to controls.
</div>

{% include recommendation.html
text= "Keep lavatories outside the clearance at roll-in showers for easier access."
%}

#### Alternate Roll-In Shower Compartment

The alternate compartment design allows the shower opening to be
partially enclosed on one side. An entry at least 36\" wide is required
at one end for maneuvering into the shower. The controls, faucet, and
shower spray unit are located on the side wall farther from the entry.
As with the standard roll-in compartment, a folding seat can be
provided.

![Alternate roll-in shower

<div class="text-center text-italic">
Note: Side wall not shown for clarity.
</div>

#### Size and Clearance

The compartment entry and dimensions provide space for making a right
angle turn into the shower using wheeled mobility aids.

![Alternate roll-in shower compartment that is 60" wide min. and 36"

walls.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/17.jpg){: .img-large}

<div class="clearfix" markdown="1">
#### Grab Bars

![Elevation of side wall shows controls and shower spray unit located
above the grab bar and below a max. height of 48". The grab bar is 33"
to 36" high measured to the top of the gripping
surface.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/18.jpg){: .img-medium .float-right}

Grab bars are required on the back wall and the side wall farther from
the entry. Grab bars can be continuous or separate. If separate, they
must be 6\" maximum from adjacent walls and must be at the same height
above the finish floor.

#### Controls, Enclosures, Thresholds

The controls, faucet, and shower spray unit must be located on the side
wall farther from the entry if no seat is provided. Shower controls and
fittings must be at least 1½\" above the grab bar so that they do not
impede the bar\'s gripping surface. Enclosures cannot obstruct controls,
faucets, shower spray units or transfer to seats. As with standard
roll-in compartments, thresholds must comply with specifications for
changes in level (i.e., ½\" high maximum and, if greater than ¼\" high,
beveled 1:2 max).
</div>

#### Alternate Roll-In Shower Compartment with Folding Seat

If provided, a folding seat must be mounted on the front wall and extend
to within 3\" from the compartment entry. The width of the front wall is
not specified, but where a seat is provided it should be wide enough to
accommodate a folding seat of sufficient size.

![Alternate roll-in shower compartment with folding seat on front wall

<div class="text-center text-italic">
Note: Side wall not shown for clarity
</div>

A benefit of the alternate compartment is that it provides a grab bar
within reach from the seat on the opposite wall. The grab bar on the
side wall is dimensioned so that it does not overlap the seat when down.
With a folding seat, the controls, faucet, and shower spray unit can be
located on the back wall opposite the seat instead of the side wall.

![Shower controls and spray unit shown on the side wall farther from the
opening or opposite the seat on the back

<div class="text-center text-italic">
Note: Front wall not shown for clarity
</div>

Whether on the side or back wall, the location of the controls, faucet,
and shower spray unit are specified so that they are within reach from
the seat.

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Transfer Shower Compartment

[[§608]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-608)]

Transfer shower compartments must have a seat (folding or non-folding)
and are sized so that controls and grab bars are usable from the seat.
The depth is also limited so that support is available from the back
wall once transfer is made to the seat. This is why the width and depth
are absolute, not minimum, dimensions of 36".

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="tablet:grid-col padding-top-5">
      <img class="img-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/23.jpg" alt="Transfer shower compartment with seat.">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

These dimensions are measured from the centerline of opposing walls
since prefabricated units often have rounded corners and slightly
tapered walls to get the form off the mold. The entry must be at least
36\" wide on the face of the compartment.

![These dimensions are measured from the centerline of opposing walls

at least 36" wide on the face of the compartment.
]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/25.jpg){: .img-medium .img-center}

<div class="border clearfix padding-1" markdown="1" style="background-color: #e2e1ef;">
![house icon]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/house.png){: .float-right .thumbnail}

In dwelling units, a seat is not required if walls are properly reinforced to support later installation of a seat in compliance with the Standards (§608.4).
</div>

#### Clearance

<div class="clearfix" markdown="1">
![Clear floor space at transfer shower compartment that is 36" min. wide
and 48" min. long measured from the control wall. The clear floor space
extends 12" min. beyond the seat wall. Person using wheelchair located
in this space and aligned with the seat for side transfer.
]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/26.jpg){: .float-right .img-medium}

The required clearance must be located so that it aligns
with the control wall and extends 12\" minimum from the seat wall. This
allows proper alignment with the seat for transfer from wheelchairs. No
elements, including lavatories, can overlap this clearance as they would
impede transfer. The seat wall or the flange around the face of
prefabricated showers may slightly offset the clearance from the shower.
It is important that this offset be minimized and to limit the gap
between the clearance and the edge of the seat (which must extend to a
point within 3\" of the compartment entry).
</div>

#### Grab Bars, Controls, and Enclosures

Grab bars are required on the wall opposite the seat and the back wall.
They can be continuous or separate. If separate, they must be at the
same height above the finish floor. The grab bars must extend across the
control wall to the entry. If separate, the grab bars must extend as
close as possible to the adjacent wall. Controls are located so that
they are within reach from outside the compartment. Enclosures cannot
obstruct controls, faucets, shower spray units, or transfer to seats.

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

#### Thresholds

Thresholds are limited to a height of ½\" and can be beveled, rounded,
or vertical. No width is specified for the threshold.

![Curb at transfer shower compartment that is vertical and ½" max. high.

<div class="border padding-1" style="background-color: #e2e1ef;">
  This guide notes some provisions in the International Building Code (IBC) and the ICC A117.1 Standard for Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities that are not found in the ADA Standards. For example, the A117.1 standard, which provides technical provisions and is referenced by the IBC, requires a vertical grab bar at showers and bathtubs. It also requires a folding seat in all roll-in showers. Not all differences between the ADA Standards and editions of the IBC and A117.1 standard are noted in this guide.
</div>

#### Gang Showers

Where gang showers are provided, a fully compliant shower is required.
Either a transfer compartment or a roll-in compartment can be integrated
with a gang shower.

##### Transfer Compartment at Gang Shower

<div class="text-center text-italic">
Note: A folding seat can be included in this solution as specified for
roll-in compartments.
</div>

### Controls at Bathtubs and Shower Compartments

[[§607.5]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-607_5)]

Controls and faucets at showers and bathtubs must be usable with one
hand and not require tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist,
or more than 5 pounds of force (lbf) to operate. Their location is
specified so that they are within accessible reach range while not
obstructing grab bars and are usable from outside transfer shower
compartments and bathtubs.

#### Shower Spray Units and Water Temperature at Bathtubs and Shower Compartments

[[§607.6]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-607_6)]

A hand-held shower spray unit that can also be used in a fixed position
is required at all accessible showers and bathtubs. The required on/off
control for the hand-held unit must have a \"non-positive shut-off\"
which does not fully stop the flow of water but allows it to be reduced.
It also prevents cross-connections and other hazards prohibited by
plumbing codes. The water temperature is limited to 120°F.

The hand-held unit needs to be reachable within a height of 48\" above
the shower floor, measured to the operable portion. Vertical bars with
adjustable heights offer more options for using it in a fixed position
and are permitted, but they also may result in the hand-held unit being
out of reach unless it is returned to a lower position. Vertical bars
cannot obstruct use of grab bars and must be at least 1½\" above the top
gripping surface.

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="border padding-1" style="background-color: #e2e1ef;">
  A fixed shower head at 48" maximum above the shower floor can substitute for a hand-held shower spray unit at shower compartments (not bathtubs) in facilities not serving as medical or long-term care facilities, transient lodging, or dwelling units.
</div>

### Grab Bars

[[§607.4]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-607_4)]

So that use of grab bars at shower compartments and bathtubs is not
impeded, any projecting objects must be located at least 12\" above the
top surface of grab bars and at least 1½\" from the bottom and ends of
grab bars. However, other grab bars and shower controls and fittings can
be located at least 1½\" above grab bars.

<div class="clearfix" markdown="1">
![Clearance shown to be 12" high min above a shower grab bar and 1 ½"
min from the bottom and sides of the bar. Controls and the hand-held
shower spray unit can be located within the 12" clearance above the bar
but other elements like soap dispensers cannot.
]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/34.jpg){: .float-left .img-medium}

_Shower controls and fittings can be 1½\" min. above grab bars, but
other projecting objects, such as soap dispensers, must be outside the
12\" min. clear space above grab bars. This required 12\" min. clearance
limits to a narrow range (45\" -- 48\") the height of accessible
operable parts depending on the grab bar height (33\" -- 36\")._
</div>

Grab bars can have circular or non-circular cross-sections but must have
rounded edges. The 1½\" clearance between the grab bar and wall is not a
minimum but an absolute dimension to prevent entrapment. Grab bars
cannot rotate within fittings. The structural strength of grab bars must
withstand a vertical or horizontal force of 250 lbs. at any point on the
grab bar, fastener, mounting device, or supporting structure.

![Grab bar with a circular cross section 1 1/4\" - 2\" in diameter and a

cross-section dimension of 2\", and a clearance 1 1/2\" from the
wall]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/35.png){: .img-large}

<div class="border padding-1" style="background-color: #e2e1ef;">
  In dwelling units and in single-user bathing facilities accessed only through a private office and not for public or common use, grab bars are not required at showers or bathtubs if walls are properly reinforced for their later installation in compliance with the Standards (§607.4 and §608.3).
</div>

### Shower Seats

[[§608.4]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-608_4)]

Seats at transfer and roll-in shower compartments can be rectangular or
L-shaped. The L-shaped seat affords users additional support and
stability from the back wall. To facilitate transfer, the seat height
(17\" -- 19\" measured to the bathroom finish floor) approximates
wheelchair seat heights. Seats must extend to a point within 3\" of the
compartment entry to minimize the transfer gap. Seats must withstand a
vertical or horizontal force of 250 lbs. at any point on the seat,
fastener, mounting device, or supporting structure. Folding seats can
have legs.

### Bathtubs

[[§607]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-607)]

Bathtubs must be equipped with a removable in-tub seat or a permanent
seat at the head end of the tub.

#### Removable In-tub Seat

Removable seats must secure to the tub so that they stay in place during
transfer and use. Specifications address seat height, depth, and
structural strength. Seats must withstand a vertical or horizontal force
of 250 lbs. at any point on the seat, fastener, mounting device, or
supporting structure. Designs providing back support are advisable but
not required.

seat.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/39.jpg){: .img-large}

![Removable seat tub seat 15" -- 16" deep and 17" -- 19"

#### Clearance and Grab Bars

<div class="clearfix" markdown="1">
![Tub with removable seat with grab bars on three walls: one on
control wall 24" min. long, two parallel bars on the back wall that are
24" min. long and 12" max. from the control wall and 24" max. from the
head end wall, and one on the head end 12" min. long located near the
front. Clearance in front of the tub is 30" wide min. and the length of
the tub. A lavatory can overlap this clearance at the control
end.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/41.jpg){: .img-medium .float-right}

The required clearance at bathtubs provides access to controls and space
for transfer to in-tub seats. Grab bars are required on three walls.
Those required on the control end and head end walls must be located at
the front edge. A compliant lavatory can overlap the clearance at the
control end, but keeping this end clear will ease access to controls.

Grab bars on the control end and head end walls must extend to the front
edge of the bathtub. A maximum distance from the bathtub front edge is
not specified, but the grab bars should be as close as possible while
allowing for the bar and attachment to be properly secured.

#### Controls and Enclosures

Controls (excluding drain stoppers) must be located below grab bars
toward the front so that they are within reach from outside the tub.
Enclosures cannot obstruct controls, faucets, shower and spray units, or
transfer to tub seats or into bathtubs or have tracks on the rim of the
open tub face.

####  Bathtub with Permanent Seat

[[§607]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-607)]

Permanent seats must be located at the head end and extend from the back
wall to or beyond the outer edge of the bathtub. Specifications for grab
bars and clearances are different for bathtubs with permanent seats. The
head end provides back support at the seat and does not contain the 12\"
minimum grab bar required at bathtubs with removable seats.

![Tub with permanent seat at head end

the end wall at the seat.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/46.jpg){: .img-large}

#### Grab Bars and Clearance

The grab bars on the back wall must extend to 15\" maximum from the head
end wall so that they are usable from the seat.

![Tub with permanent seat and parallel grab bars on the back wall that
extend 12" max. from the control wall and 15" max. from the head end
wall. One bar is 33" -- 36" high and the other is 8" -- 10" above the
tub rim. The height of the seat is 17" -- 19."]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/47.jpg){: .img-large}

![Clearance at a tub with a permanent seat is 30" wide min. and extends
the length of the tub plus 12" beyond the head end wall. Persons using
wheelchair shown aligning with permanent seat for side transfer.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/48a.png){: .img-large}

The clearance in front of the bathtub must extend 12\" minimum beyond
the seat wall so people using wheelchairs can align with the seat for
lateral transfer. The seat wall often extends farther than the edge of
the bathtub. While the bathtub clearance does not have to abut the
bathtub, it is important that any offset necessary for the seat wall be
minimized

### Example Bathrooms

The Standards do not directly specify the size of bathrooms which is
determined by the layout, the type and number of fixtures, and other
factors and design choices. How various requirements are met, including
fixture clearances, turning space, and door maneuvering clearance will
determine the minimum dimensions of the room. Bathing facilities,
including single-user bathrooms, can be configured in many different
ways. The sample layouts shown here are used only as examples of how the
technical requirements apply.

### Bathroom with Standard Roll-In Shower Compartment

This example of a single-user bathing facility features a standard
roll-in shower compartment.

![Bathroom with roll-in shower, water closet, and
lavatory]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/49.jpg){: .img-large}

![Plan view of bathroom with roll-in shower in a back corner and
lavatory in a counter next to it in the other back corner. A water
closet is in the front corner opposite the shower. A door is located in
the other front corner opposite the lavatory.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/50.jpg){: .img-large}

#### Fixture Clearances

Specified clearances are required at the lavatory, water closet, and
shower compartment. Fixture clearances can overlap. The door cannot
swing into fixture clearances (unless, in the case of single-user
facilities, unobstructed wheelchair space is provided in the room beyond
the arc of the door swing). Clear floor space is also required at
provided dispensers, receptacles, controls and other operable parts,
clothes hooks, and shelves (not shown).

![Bathroom with clearances shown at roll-in shower, lavatory, and water
closet. The shower and water closet clearances partly overlap. The door
does not swing into fixture
clearances.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/51.jpg){: .img-large}

#### Turning Space

Turning space is required in the room (60\" diameter circle or a
T-shaped space). The turning space can overlap fixture clearances, and
doors can swing into the turning space under any condition. Elements
with compliant knee and toe space, such as a lavatory, can partially
overlap the turning space.

![Door maneuvering clearance shown in bathroom with roll-in
shower.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/53.png){: .img-large}

<div class="grid-container">

    <div class="tablet:grid-col padding-top-5">
      <span class="text-italic">The door maneuvering clearance can be offset up to 8" from the face of the door. Elements, such as grab bars, that can fit within this offset are permitted so long as they do not protrude into the minimum maneuvering clearance.</span>

### Bathroom with Alternate Roll-In Shower Compartment

This example shows a single-user bathing facility with an alternate
roll-in shower compartment that is equipped with a folding seat.

![Bathroom with alternate roll-in shower, a counter with two
lavatories, and a water closet.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/56.jpg){: .img-large}

![Plan view shows alternate roll-in shower with adjacent counter with
two lavatories. The water closet is opposite the lavatories. A door is
located in a wall opposite the shower between the lavatory and the water
closet.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/57.png){: .img-large}

#### Fixture Clearances and Clear Floor Space Beyond Door Swing

An accessible route must connect to the entry of the alternate roll-in
shower compartment, but additional clearance at the fixture is not
required. At least one lavatory must provide the required clearance.
Since the door swings into the clearance of one fixture (the water
closet), an unobstructed clear floor space 30\" minimum by 48\" minimum
is required in the room beyond the door swing. This provides space in
single-user facilities to enter the room and clear the door. The
location or orientation of the space is not specified, but it should be
easy to occupy upon entry into the room.

![Bathroom with alternate roll-in shower and clearances shown at one
lavatory and the water closet. The door swings into the water closet
clearance. Unobstructed clear floor space is provided beyond the swing
of the door. This space overlaps the fixture clearances.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/58.png){: .img-large}

#### Turning Space

As noted above, doors can swing into the turning space in all cases.
While elements with compliant knee and toe space can partially overlap
the turning space, keeping the turning space entirely clear enhances
usability.

![Bathroom with alternate roll-in shower and circular turning space
shown in front of the door (which swings into it).]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/59.png){: .img-large}

#### Door Maneuvering Clearance

The door maneuvering clearance must always be clear of any fixtures or
elements.

![Bathroom with alternate roll-in shower and door maneuvering clearance
shown. No fixture overlaps the door maneuvering
clearance.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/60.png){: .img-large}

### Bathroom with a Bathtub

A bathtub can be provided instead of a shower compartment. Compliant
bathtubs must have either a removable in-tub seat as shown here or a
permanent seat.

![Bathroom with tub and removable seat, lavatory, and water closet.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/61.jpg){: .img-large}

![Bathroom with a located in the front wall. The tub is in one back
corner opposite the water closet which is in the other back corner. The
lavatory is the front corner on the same wall as the water
closet,]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/62.png){: .img-large}

#### Fixture Clearances and Clear Floor Space Beyond Door Swing

An unobstructed clear floor space 30\" minimum by 48\" minimum is
required in this design because the door swings into fixture clearances
(lavatory and bathtub). (In residential dwelling units, a lavatory
adjacent to the water closet can overlap a portion of the water closet
clearance if the clearance depth is increased by 10\", but keeping the
space beside the water closet clear provides better access by allowing
positioning for side transfers).

![Bathroom with tub with clearances at tub, water closet, and lavatory
highlighted. The door swings into the tub and lavatory clearances.
Unobstructed wheelchair space is provided beyond the swing of the
door.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/63.png){: .img-large}

#### Option: Bathtub with a Permanent Seat

Bathtubs with a permanent seat require more clearance. The clearance
must extend the full length of the bathtub and seat and at least 12\"
beyond the seat to allow proper alignment for transfer.

![Bathroom with same layout but with a tub that has a permanent seat.
The tub clearance, which extends a foot beyond the seat wall, is
shown.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/64.png){: .img-large}

#### Turning Space

![Bathroom with tub and removable seat with turning space shown in the
middle of the room. The door swings into the turning space.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/65.png){: .img-large}

#### Door Maneuvering Clearance

![Bathroom with tub and removable seat with turning space shown in the
middle of the room. The door swings into the turning
space.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/66.png){: .img-large}

### Bathroom with Transfer Shower Compartment and Bathtub

Only one bathtub or shower compartment is required to comply in a
bathing facility. If a bathroom has a separate bathtub and shower
compartment, providing access to both is advisable for greater access
but not required. In this configuration, providing the required
clearance at the transfer shower does not impact the size of the room.
Transfer shower compartments must have a seat.

![Bathroom with transfer shower, tub with permanent seat, water closet, and lavatory.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/67.jpg){: .img-large}

![The transfer shower and tub are next to each other on one wall. A
water closet and adjacent counter with two lavatories are opposite the
shower and tub. A door is located on a side wall between the shower and
lavatories.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/68.jpg){: .img-large}

#### Fixture Clearances and Clear Floor Space Beyond Door Swing

Since this bathtub has a permanent seat, the required clearance extends
at least 12\" beyond the head end wall. Similarly, the clearance at the
transfer shower must extend the same distance beyond the seat wall. The
shower and bathtub clearances partially overlap. The door swings into
these clearances, and the required unobstructed wheelchair space beyond
the door swing is easily accommodated in this design.

![Bathroom with transfer shower and tub with fixture clearances shown.
Most partially overlap. The door swings into the shower and tub
clearances. An unobstructed clear floor space is provided beyond the
swing of the
door.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/69.jpg){: .img-large}

#### Turning Space and Door Maneuvering Clearance

![Bathroom with transfer shower and tub with door maneuvering clearance and turning space shown. No fixture overlaps the door maneuvering clearance.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/70.jpg){: .img-large}

### Multi-User Bathroom with Transfer Shower Compartments

In multi-user bathing facilities, as in single-user bathrooms, the
requirements are based on the type and number of bathing fixtures and
elements provided.

![Multi-user shower room with 3 lavatories, 2 urinals, 2 toilet
compartments, and 5 shower stalls.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/71.png){: .img-large}

above.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/72.png){: .img-large}

![Plan view of multi-user shower room with notes: At least one
wheelchair accessible toilet compartment (§213.3.1), including door
maneuvering clearance at the compartment door. At least one ambulatory
accessible toilet compartment in restrooms with at least 6 toilet
compartments or where the combined total of toilets and urinals is at
least 6 fixtures (§213.3.1). At least one compliant urinal where more
than one urinal is provided (§213.3.3). At least one compliant lavatory
(not located in a toilet compartment) and at least one compliant mirror,
where provided (§213.3.4 and §213.3.5). At least one compliant shower or
bathtub (§213.3.6). Where coat hooks or shelves are provided, at least
one of each type must serve the accessible shower or bathtub (§213.3.7).
Dispensers, receptacles, and other operable parts must comply where
provided (§205). Turning space (§603.2.1).]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/bathing-rooms/73.jpg){: .img-large}

### Common Questions

![question mark]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}ques.jpg){: .float-right .thumbnail} 

#### Bathing Rooms

##### Are bathing rooms that serve employees but not the public required to be accessible?

Yes. Public and common use bathing rooms, including those used
exclusively by employees, must comply. Private bathrooms for a single
occupant accessed only through a private office are permitted limited
exceptions for certain access features, such as the later installation
of grab bars if walls have blocking or are reinforced.

##### Is access required to a unisex bathing room that is provided in addition to accessible men's and women's bathing rooms?

Yes. Unisex bathing facilities must be accessible, including where they
are provided in addition to accesible men\'s and women\'s bathing
facilities.

##### Can access be provided to a unisex bathing room instead of to separate sex bathing rooms?

If men\'s and women\'s bathing rooms are provided, they must be
accessible even if a unisex bathing room is also provided. However, in
alterations when it is technically infeasible to make existing men\'s
and women\'s bathing facilities comply, an accessible unisex bathing
room can be provided instead if it is located on the same floor and in
the same area as the men\'s and women\'s bathing facilities (§213.2, Ex.
1).

##### If a bathing facility has multiple shower compartments or bathtubs located in separate rooms for privacy, how does scoping apply?

If multiple shower compartments or bathtubs are provided in a multi-user
shower or bathing room, then at least one shower compartment or bathtub
must comply (§213.3.6), including where showers or tubs are enclosed by
full-height partitions for privacy. If single-user bathing rooms are
provided in a cluster and accessed directly from a common use corridor
or hallway, then each is required to comply as a separate bathing room.
Where portable bathing units are provided, at least 5% at each cluster
must comply (§213.2).

##### Can bathing rooms be designed for assisted use instead of independent access?

In licensed medical care and long-term care facilities, bathing rooms
that are part of accessible patient or resident sleeping rooms must
comply. The Standards cover independent accessibility and do not address
design for use that is assisted by medical or resident care personnel.
Design features for assisted use that conflict with requirements of the
Standards can be provided in those bathing rooms that are not required
to meet the Standards. Under the provision of "equivalent
facilitation" (§103), the Standards permit alternatives to prescribed
requirements that result in "substantially equivalent or greater
accessibility and usability."

##### Can bathing room doors swing into turning space and fixture clearances?

Bathroom doors can swing into the turning space. They cannot swing into
the clearance required at plumbing fixtures, except at single user
bathing rooms where unobstructed wheelchair space is provided in the
room beyond the arc of the door swing (§603.2.3, Ex. 2). In addition,
doors can swing into fixture clearances at single-occupant bathing rooms
accessed only through a private office and not for common use if the
swing of the door can be reversed (§603.2.3, Ex. 1).

##### Must bathing rooms be identified by the International Symbol of Accessibility (ISA)?

Labeling accessible bathing rooms with the ISA is required only where
inaccessible bathing rooms are present. At least 5% of single user
portable bathing units of the same type in each cluster must comply and
be identified by the ISA unless all are accessible (§213.2., Ex. 3,
§216.8). In alterations where existing bathing rooms do not comply,
directional signs with the ISA must be provided to indicate the location
of the nearest accessible bathing room which must be labeled by the ISA
(§216.8).

##### In transient lodging facilities, can roll-in showers be provided in those accessible guest rooms not required to have them?

A specified portion of accessible guest rooms in transient lodging
facilities with over 50 guest rooms must have a roll-in shower with a
folding seat (§224.2). This shower design is required for transient
lodging facilities because it affords users the option to roll in or to
transfer to a seat. To provide additional bathing options, the Standards
specify transfer showers and/or bathtubs for the other guest rooms
required to comply, which are referred to as \"Rooms Without Roll-in
Showers\" (Table 224.2). Roll-in showers are not specified for these
other guest rooms, but the Standards do permit alternatives to
prescribed requirements that result in \"substantially equivalent or
greater accessibility and usability\" under the provision for
\"equivalent facilitation\" (§103). It is important that departures from
the types of bathing fixtures specified for guest rooms (roll-in showers
versus transfer showers or bathtubs) under equivalent facilitation
provide people with disabilities an equal or greater level of choice.
For example, like the required roll-in showers, any additional roll-in
showers provided instead of a transfer shower or bathtub should be
equipped with seats. Further, offering a choice of standard and
alternate roll-in showers will also enhance options, as each has its own
benefits; the alternate roll-in shower with a seat is similar to a
transfer shower by providing a grab bar opposite the seat that is within
reach, while the standard roll-in shower provides easier maneuvering
into the shower because the entry is as wide as the compartment.
Additionally, accessible guest rooms must be dispersed among the various
classes of guest rooms and provide choices in amenities comparable to
those afforded other guests (§224.5). If one type of bathing fixture is
provided in a class of guest room, that same type of fixture should be
provided in the accessible guest room in that class to ensure an
equivalent level of choice in amenities.

##### Are benches required in bathing facilities?

The Standards require a compliant bench in accessible dressing rooms,
fitting rooms, and locker rooms (§803.4). A bench is not required in
bathing facilities generally (except those that are part of locker
rooms). If changing or dressing rooms are provided in bathing rooms,
they must comply as dressing rooms and include a compliant bench.
Providing a compliant bench in all bathing rooms will provide greater
accessibility.

#### Shower Compartments

##### Are seats required in roll-in showers?

Seats are not required in roll-in shower compartments except folding
seats that are required to be provided in a portion of accessible guest
rooms in transient lodging facilities. Folding seats are recommended in
all roll-in showers because they provide options for users. They benefit
people with disabilities who prefer to sit and accommodate those who
wish to transfer from wheeled mobility aids. Seats (either folding or
non-folding) are required in transfer shower compartments.

##### Are roll-in showers preferred over transfer showers?

Preferences vary among users and each shower type has benefits. Transfer
shower compartments always have a seat which is helpful to many people
with disabilities, including those who are ambulatory. However, they do
not provide any roll-in option for those who prefer not to transfer to a
seat. Roll-in showers provide easier access for those who do not wish to
transfer. However, many people need to transfer from wheelchairs to
either a shower seat or shower chair. For these reasons, designs that
afford users options are better, such as equipping all roll-in showers
with folding seats. In facilities with multiple bathrooms or bathing
facilities, it is generally advisable to provide different types of
bathing fixtures to allow more options.

##### Can transfer shower compartments be larger than 36" by 36"?

No. These are absolute, not minimum, dimensions. The specified size
provides sufficient space while keeping the controls and grab bars
within reach of the seat. The back wall also provides support at the
seat.

##### Can the corners of prefabricated shower compartments be rounded?

Yes. Shower compartments are measured at the center points (horizontal
and vertical) of opposing sides to permit rounded corners.

##### Is a fixed shower head required in addition to the hand-held shower spray unit?

The Standards require only a hand-held shower spray unit that is also
usable in a fixed position. A separate fixed shower head at a standard
height can be provided in addition to the hand-held shower spray unit. A
fixed shower head at 48\" maximum above the shower floor can substitute
for a hand-held shower spray unit at shower compartments except in
medical or long-term care facilities, transient lodging, or dwelling
units.

##### Can access be provided at gang showers?

Yes. Accessible shower compartments can be incorporated into gang
showers provided they meet all applicable requirements.

##### Can shower grab bars be continuous?

Yes. Grab bars at showers can be continuous or separate.

##### If separate shower grab bars are provided, must they be at the same height?

Yes. Grab bars required at showers must be installed at the same height
(§608.3).

##### Can a shower grab bar be located on a half wall or wing wall?

Yes. Grab bars, if properly secured, can be located on a half wall or
wing wall. However, it is important that adequate wall surface is
available to provide support and to keep arms from slipping off the bar.
Wall surface that extends the full height of the required 12\" clearance
above grab bars, or preferably to the standard adult shoulder height for
standees, should provide sufficient support in using grab bars.

##### How close must the grab bar extend to the shower opening?

It is important that the grab bar on the control wall of a transfer
shower extend close to the shower entry so that it is usable from
outside the compartment for transfer. A maximum horizontal distance
between the grab bar and the entry is not specified in the Standards. In
standard roll-in showers, grab bars are generally required to extend
near the opening; if the shower is considerably deeper than the 30\"
minimum, grab bars should be lengthened so that they extend to the
entry, but this is not required.

##### How close must the grab bar extend to the corner of the shower compartment?

In roll-in showers, grab bars must be located 6\" maximum from adjacent
walls. In a transfer shower, grab bars that are separate must extend as
close as feasible to the adjacent wall (a maximum distance is not
specified).

##### Can shower diverter valves be located on fixed shower heads mounted more than 48" above the shower floor?

No. Shower controls, including diverters for shower spray handheld
units, must be within the location specified for shower controls at
transfer and roll-in shower compartments. The maximum height is 48\"
above the shower floor.

##### Can a handheld shower spray unit be mounted to a vertical bar that provides adjustable positions above a height of 48"?

Yes. Handheld shower spray units can be mounted to vertical bars with
adjustable heights. The bar must be located so that the shower spray
unit can be positioned within the specified location and maximum 48\"
height. The vertical bar cannot obstruct the use of grab bars (§608.6);
while it can be located within the 12" min. clearance above the grab
bar as a shower fitting, it must allow a clearance of at least 1½"
above the bar and cannot extend behind the grab bar. Shower spray units
should be returned to a lower position so that they remain within
accessible reach for other users.

##### Can accessible shower compartments have doors instead of curtains?

Shower enclosures, including doors, cannot obstruct controls, faucets,
shower spray units, or transfer from wheelchairs to transfer seats
(§608.8). Shower doors on transfer compartments and standard roll-in
compartments will typically fail this test. For example, a swing door on
a transfer shower will hinder transfer unless it can swing clear of the
required clearance, but it will be very hard to close such a door from
the shower seat. A door may be possible on an alternate roll-in shower
if the shower opening provides a clear width of at least 36\" min. when
the door is open 90 degrees.

##### Are rinsing showers at swimming pools, beaches, and camping areas required to comply as showers?

Shower fixtures located outside bathrooms for use at swimming pools and
beaches are not required to comply as showers. However, they must still
meet applicable requirements for operable parts, including clear floor
space and compliant controls within accessible reach range. The ABA
Standards, which apply to federally funded facilities, include
provisions for outdoor developed areas on federal lands. These
provisions include requirements for outdoor rinsing showers (§1011.7)
which can be consulted as a reference for other types of outdoor sites. 

#### Grab Bars and Shower Spray Units

##### Can grab bar attachments be located at points along the bar instead of at the ends?

Yes. Grab bar attachments can be at points other than the ends of grab
bars.

##### How is the length of grab bars measured?

Grab bar length is measured to the centerline of the return, consistent
with industry convention. This also applies to post-mounted grab bars.
When attached at points other than the ends (e.g., "European" style
grab bars), the length is measured to the end of the bar.

##### Must grab bars have a peened or other textured surface?

No. The Standards do not require grab bars to have peened or textured
surfaces.

##### Is a vertical grab bar required by the Standards?

No. The ADA Standards do not require a vertical grab bar at bathing
fixtures. Vertical bars are helpful and provide support when stepping
into bathtubs or showers. The ICC A117.1 standard, which is referenced
by the International Building Code, requires an 18\" minimum vertical
grab bar at transfer showers and bathtubs.

##### What is a non-positive shut-off for the on/off control on hand-held shower spray units?

The handheld shower spray unit must have a "non-positive shut-off" to
prevent cross- connections and other hazards prohibited by plumbing
codes. A non-positive shut-off does not completely stop the flow of
water so that the main shut-off is still used.

#### Bathtubs

##### Do requirements for bathtubs also apply to spa tubs, or tubs used for rehabilitation, physical therapy, or sports training?

The requirements for bathtubs apply only to bathtubs used for bathing.
Requirements for spas (§242.4), which specify access by lifts or
transfer walls or systems, apply to spa tubs.

##### Do the Standards specify the height of bathtub walls?

No. The Standards specify the height of removable and permanent tub
seats (17" -- 19") but not the height of tub walls or rims. The
outside tub wall should be the same height as permanent tub seats for
easier access.
