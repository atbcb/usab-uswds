This guide explains requirements in the [ADA
Standards](/guidelines-and-standards/buildings-and-sites/about-the-ada-standards/ada-standards)
for protruding objects.

### Protruding Objects \[[§204](/guidelines-and-standards/buildings-and-sites/about-the-ada-standards/ada-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements#204%20Protruding%20Objects)\]

To prevent hazards to people with vision impairments, the standards
limit the projection of objects into circulation paths. These
requirements apply to all circulation paths and are not limited to
accessible routes. Circulation paths include interior and exterior
walks, paths, hallways, courtyards, elevators, platform lifts, ramps,
stairways, and landings.

\
**Examples of Protruding Objects**

![Examples of protruding objects: sconces, handrails, cabinets, drinking
fountains and other elements that project into circulation paths).
Notes: These elements must comply with provisions for protruding objects
(unless they are located within cane sweep or above headroom clearance).
Requirements for protruding objects apply to all interior and exterior
circulation paths of sites. They are not limited to hallways and
corridors and apply equally to circulation paths in rooms and spaces.

### Protrusion Limits \[[§307.2](/guidelines-and-standards/buildings-and-sites/about-the-ada-standards/ada-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks#307%20Protruding%20Objects)\]

People with vision impairments often travel closely along walls which
can provide wayfinding cues sometime called a "shoreline." Objects
mounted on walls, partitions, columns, and other elements along
circulation paths can pose hazards unless their projection is limited.
Those with leading edges that are within cane sweep (27" high maximum)
or that provide minimum headroom clearance (80" minimum) do not pose
hazards and can protrude any amount.

**Limits of Protruding Objects**

![Wall-mounted objects with leading edges above 27" and less than 80"
are limited to a 4" max. projection (4 ½" max. for handrails). Notes and
labels: Protruding object limits apply to the full width of circulation
paths; Objects above headroom clearance can protrude any amount;
Protruding objects cannot reduce the minimum width of accessible routes;
Objects with leading edges within cane sweep can protrude any
amount.](/images/guidelines_standards/Buildings_Sites/guides/chapter3/3po3-text.jpg){width="550"

**Location Above Detectable Elements**

Objects located above elements that are within cane sweep can protrude
4" maximum from the leading edge of such elements provided that any
required reach or clear floor space is not obstructed.

**Side Partitions and Wing Walls**

Side partitions or panels and wing walls can also be used to make
protruding objects compliant. The bottom edge of panels or partitions
must be 27" high maximum.

\

  

 

 

 

 

\
**Recessed Objects**

Objects can be recessed in alcoves so that they do not project more than
4" into circulation paths. Alcoves must be sized to accommodate required
clear floor space at accessible elements.

Elements, such as wheelchair accessible drinking fountains, must provide
a knee clearance of at least 27". If located to provide, but not exceed
this clearance (27" above the floor or ground absolute), they are not
protruding objects because the leading edge will be within cane
detection.

site and a wall bump-out on the

*A wheelchair accessible unit located 27" absolute above the ground or
floor is cane detectable and can be used to enclose one side of high
units for standing access. In this instance, the 27" height is
effectively an absolute dimension because it is the minimum required for
knee clearance and the maximum specified for cane detection.*

 

 

 

 

### Post-Mounted Objects \[[§307.3](/guidelines-and-standards/buildings-and-sites/about-the-ada-standards/ada-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks#307%20Protruding%20Objects)\]

Free-standing objects with leading edges 27" to 80" high that are
mounted on posts or pylons cannot protrude more than 12" into
circulation paths. The 12" limit also applies to the clearance between
multiple posts (excluding the sloping portions of handrails).

with same protrusion limits and 12\" max. distance between

Objects with leading edges 27" maximum or above 80" can protrude any
amount from posts or pylons.

### Vertical Clearance \[[§307.4](/guidelines-and-standards/buildings-and-sites/about-the-ada-standards/ada-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks#307%20Protruding%20Objects)\]

Headroom clearance of at least 80" high is required along all
circulation paths (except at doors and doorways where a 78" minimum
clearance is permitted to accommodate door stops and closers).

Fixed barriers, such as guardrails, are required where the vertical
clearance is less than 80" such as at open stairways and along sloped or
curved walls. Barriers must have leading edges no higher than 27" so
that they are within cane sweep. Fixed planters, benches, and other
elements can be used instead of guardrails.

 

**Barriers at Circulation Areas with Reduced Vertical Clearance**

It is recommended that barriers be high enough so that they are not mistaken for a step or other change in level and do not pose a tripping hazard.

### Common Questions

*Are requirements for protruding objects limited to hallways and
corridors?*

No, requirements for protruding objects apply to all circulation paths,
including those in rooms and spaces off corridors. They apply to both
interior and exterior circulation paths.

*Do drinking fountains pose hazards as protruding objects?*

Cantilevered units at standard heights for people who stand must be
recessed or protected as protruding objects. This is not required for
wheelchair accessible units with no more than a 27" clearance below (the
minimum required for knee clearance and the maximum recognized for cane
detection).

*Can curbs be used to indicate areas with less than 80" of vertical
clearance?*

The standards specify a maximum height (27") for the leading edge of
barriers so they are within cane sweep, but a minimum height is not
specified. Curbs may be mistaken for a step or change in level, instead
of a barrier. For this reason, barriers significantly higher than a curb
or riser, such as a guardrail, planter box, bench, parapet wall, or
similar elements are recommended.
