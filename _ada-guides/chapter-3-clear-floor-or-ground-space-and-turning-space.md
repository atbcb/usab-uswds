---
This guide explains requirements in the [ADA
Standards](../ada-standards.html) for clear floor or ground space and
turning space. Clearances are required at accessible elements, fixtures,
and controls so that people with disabilities, including those who use
wheelchairs, can approach and use them. The standards also address
maneuvering space for wheelchair turning. Provisions throughout the
standards reference these basic "building block" requirements.

### Clear Floor or Ground Space

[[§305](../ada-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#305%20Clear%20Floor%20or%20Ground%20Space)]

Sufficient clear floor or ground space is required at accessible
controls, operable parts, drinking fountains, lavatories and sinks, ATMs
and fare machines, appliances, beds, and other elements. Provisions for
these elements apply the clear floor or ground specifications in 305.

### Position

[[§305.5](../ada-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#305%20Clear%20Floor%20or%20Ground%20Space)]

At most elements, clear floor or ground space can be positioned for
either a forward or a side approach. For better usability, a forward
approach is required at certain elements, including dining and work
surfaces, drinking fountains, lavatories, and most sinks. At other
elements, a side approach is allowed. A side approach is typically
provided or required at sales and service counters, beds, and most
appliances.

### Surface and Size

[[§305.2](../ada-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#305%20Clear%20Floor%20or%20Ground%20Space) and [§305.3](../ada-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#305%20Clear%20Floor%20or%20Ground%20Space)]

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="tablet:grid-col">
      <p>Clear floor spaces must meet requirements for ground and floor surfaces, including criteria for firmness, stability, and slip resistance. They must be free of level changes and not slope more than 1:48.</p>
      <p>The minimum size (30” by 48”) applies whether the space is positioned for forward or side approaches. Additional space is required when the space is confined on three sides and is obstructed for more than half the depth, such as when elements are recessed in alcoves.</p>

### Approach and Maneuvering Clearance

[[§305.6](../ada-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#305%20Clear%20Floor%20or%20Ground%20Space) and [§305.7](../ada-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#305%20Clear%20Floor%20or%20Ground%20Space)]

Where the space is obstructed on both sides for more than half the depth, additional clearance is required for maneuvering. Accessible routes must connect to the unobstructed side of the space.

### Knee and Toe Space

[[§305.4](../ada-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#305%20Clear%20Floor%20or%20Ground%20Space) and [§306](../ada-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#306%20Knee%20and%20Toe%20Clearance)]

Objects that provide space for toes or knees can overlap a portion of
the clear floor space. Knee and toe space allows a closer approach to
elements and reduces the reach to operable parts. It is required at some
elements, such as drinking fountains and lavatories, so that people
using wheelchairs can pull up to them.

### Turning Space

[[§304](../ada-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#304%20Turning%20Space)]

![icons representing toilet/bathing facilities, dressing rooms,
transient lodging, dwelling units, medical care facilities, and prison
cells]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter3/3cfs17.jpg){: .float-right .thumbnail}

Turning space is required in these accessible rooms and
spaces:

- toilet and bathing facilities
- dressing, fitting, and locker rooms
- transient lodging guest rooms
- dwelling units (all rooms on an accessible route)
- patient bedrooms
- holding and housing cells
- saunas and steam rooms
- raised courtroom stations served by ramps or lifts with entry ramps
- certain recreation spaces (amusement ride load/ unload areas,
    fishing piers and platforms, play components, and shooting
    facilities)

Space for turning is also required along accessible routes where a 180
degree turn around an obstruction less than 48" wide is required
(§403.5.2).

#### Clear Width at 180 Degree Turn Around a Narrow Obstruction

![Turning space at obstructions less than 48\" long require a clearance
of 60\" min. (or 48\" min. if both connecting routes are 42\" min.
wide)]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter3/3cfs16.jpg){: .img-large}

{% include recommendation.html
text= "Turning space is recommended in small spaces with entrapment risks as well as at dead-end aisles and corridors so that people using wheeled mobility aids do not have to back up considerable distances."
%}

#### Maneuvering for Turns

![Person in plan view turning wheelchair by moving wheels in opposite
directions]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter3/3cfs18.jpg){: .float-right .img-medium}

Maneuvering for 180 degree turns varies by person and the mobility aid
used. An efficient way of turning using a manual wheelchair is to turn
the wheels in opposite directions for a pivoting turn. Some power chairs
also may permit tight circular turns.

A three-point turn is common when using scooters and other motorized
devices that have a larger turning radius.

### Size

[[§304.3](../ada-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#304%20Turning%20Space)]

Turning space can be provided in the shape of a circle or a "T". Elements
with knee and toe space can overlap a portion of the turning space.

#### Circular Turning Space

{% include recommendation.html
text= "To provide easier access, locate elements with knee and toe space outside the turning space or, with circular space, limit overlap to approximately 12\" so that wheelchair space 48\" long minimum remains clear."
%}

#### T-Shaped Turning Space

T-shaped space can be configured for approach on any segment (stem or
either arm).

![T-shaped turning space with overall width of 60\" min. and overall
depth of 60\" min. with each arm and stem 36\" wide min. Object with
knee and toe space, such as a sink, can overlap only one segment of the
the T; the other 2 segments must be clear for approach and backing
up.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter3/3cfs21.jpg){: .img-large}

### Door Swing and Other Space Requirements

[[§304.4](../ada-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks.html#304%20Turning%20Space)]

Doors can swing into the turning space. The turning space can overlap
other space requirements, including clear floor space required at
elements and fixtures.

### Common Questions

![question mark]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}ques.jpg){: .float-right .thumbnail}

#### Is clear floor space required to be centered on elements?

The standards require the clear floor space to be centered on wheelchair
accessible drinking fountains (forward approach), kitchen work surfaces,
(forward approach), and washers and dryers (side approach). Centering
the clear floor space on other elements is often advisable, but not
required.

#### Can doors swing into required clear floor or ground space?

Doors cannot swing into required clear floor or ground spaces in these
specific instances:

- clear floor space at controls for automatic and power assisted doors
    and gates (404.3.5)
- fixture clearances in toilet and bathing facilities (except those
    that are single user where wheelchair space beyond the door swing is
    provided) (603.2.3)
- clear floor space required at benches in saunas and steam rooms
    (612.2)
- clear floor space required at tactile signs, which must be beyond
    the arc of any door swing between the closed position and 45 degree
    open position (703.4.2)
- dressing, fitting, or locker rooms unless wheelchair space is
    provided beyond the arc of the door swing (803.3)

In other locations, doors can swing into clear floor or ground space,
although locating door swing outside required clearances is advisable.

#### Can doors swing into turning space?

Yes, doors can swing into turning space.

#### Can clear floor/ground space or turning space overlap other space requirements?

Yes, clear floor or ground spaces and turning space can overlap other
required clearances, including other clear floor spaces, door
maneuvering clearances, and fixture clearances.

#### Is turning space required in all rooms and spaces?

No. Turning space is required in certain spaces, such as toilet and
bathing facilities, dressing and fitting rooms, and transient lodging
guest rooms. Unless addressed by a specific requirement for turning
space in the standards, other spaces are not required to provide them,
including lobbies, offices, and meeting rooms.
