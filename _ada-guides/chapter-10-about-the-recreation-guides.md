### Introduction

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a comprehensive civil
rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability. The
ADA requires that newly constructed and altered state and local
government facilities, places of public accommodation, and commercial
facilities be readily accessible to, and usable by, individuals with
disabilities. The ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) is the standard
applied to buildings and facilities. Recreational facilities, including
amusement park rides, are among the facilities required to comply with
the ADA.

The Access Board issued accessibility guidelines for newly constructed
and altered recreation facilities in 2002. The recreation facility
guidelines are a supplement to ADAAG. As a supplement, they must be used
in conjunction with ADAAG. References to ADAAG are mentioned throughout
this summary. Once these guidelines are adopted by the Department of
Justice (DOJ), all newly designed, constructed and altered recreation
facilities covered by the ADA will be required to comply.

The recreation facility guidelines cover the following facilities and
elements:

-   Amusement rides
-   Boating facilities
-   Fishing piers and platforms
-   Miniature golf courses
-   Golf courses
-   Exercise equipment
-   Bowling lanes
-   Shooting facilities
-   Swimming pools, wading pools, and spas

This guide is intended to help designers and operators in using the
accessibility guidelines for amusement park rides. These guidelines
establish minimum accessibility requirements for newly designed or newly
constructed and altered amusement park rides. This guide is not a
collection of amusement ride designs. Rather, it provides specifications
for elements of amusement rides to create a general level of usability
for individuals with disabilities. Emphasis is placed on ensuring that
individuals with disabilities are generally able to access the amusement
ride and use a variety of elements. Designers and operators are
encouraged to exceed the guidelines where possible to provide increased
accessibility and opportunities. Incorporating accessibility into the
design of an amusement ride should begin early in the planning process
with careful consideration to accessible routes and providing access to
rides.

The recreation facility guidelines were developed with significant
public participation. In 1993, the Access Board established an advisory
committee of 27 members to recommend accessibility guidelines for
recreation facilities. The Recreation Access Advisory Committee
represented the following groups and associations:

-   American Ski Federation
-   American Society for Testing and Materials (Public Playground Safety
    Committee)
-   American Society of Landscape Architects
-   Beneficial Designs
-   City and County of San Francisco, California, Department of Public
    Works
-   Disabled American Veterans
-   Environmental Access
-   Golf Course Superintendents Association of America
-   Hawaii Disability and Communication Access Board
-   International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions
-   Katherine McGuinness and Associates
-   Lehman, Smith, and Wiseman Associates
-   Michigan Department of Natural Resources
-   National Council on Independent Living
-   National Park Service
-   National Recreation and Park Association
-   New Jersey Department of Community Affairs
-   Outdoor Amusement Business Association
-   Paralyzed Veterans of America
-   Professional Golfer's Association
-   Self Help for Hard of Hearing People
-   States Organization for Boating Access
-   Universal Studios
-   U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
-   U.S. Forest Service
-   Y.M.C.A. of the U.S.A.
-   Walt Disney Imagineering

The public was given an opportunity to comment on the recommended
accessibility guidelines, and the Access Board made changes to the
recommended guidelines based on the public comments. A notice of
proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was published in the Federal Register in July
1999, followed by a five-month public comment period. Further input from
the public was sought in July 2000 when the Access Board published a
draft final rule soliciting comment. A final rule was published in
September 2002.
