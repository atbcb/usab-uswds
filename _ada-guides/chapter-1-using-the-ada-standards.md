The design standards issued under the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) by the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation
are used to ensure access to the built environment for people with
disabilities. The [ADA Standards]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/) apply
nationwide, in addition to any applicable state or local codes, where
facilities are newly built or altered. Most facilities in the public and
private sectors are covered by the ADA.

### Facilities Covered by the ADA

#### State and Local Government Facilities

![government building]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter1-ada/gov.jpg){: .float-right .thumbnail}

Units of government at the state, county, and local levels are subject
to the ADA and must comply with the ADA Standards in new construction
and alterations. All types of public facilities are covered, including
schools, hospitals, public housing, courthouses, and prisons. Federal
facilities are not covered by the ADA, but by an earlier law, the
[Architectural Barriers Act (ABA)]({{ site.baseurl }}/aba/) and must meet separate, though very
similar, standards.

#### Places of Public Accommodation and Commercial Facilities

![store front and factory]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter1-ada/1ada2.jpg){: .float-right .thumbnail}

In the private sector, the ADA Standards apply to places of public
accommodation and commercial facilities. Places of public accommodation
are facilities that affect commerce and that fall within twelve
categories listed in the statute, including stores and shops,
restaurants and bars, sales or rental establishments, service
establishments, theaters, places of lodging, recreation facilities,
assembly areas, private museums, places of education, and others. Nearly
all types of private businesses that serve the public are included in
the twelve categories, regardless of size. Commercial facilities include
office buildings, factories, warehouses, manufacturing plants, and other
facilities whose operations affect commerce.

#### Transportation Facilities

![train]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter1-ada/1ada3.jpg){: .float-right .thumbnail .maxh-10}

Bus stops and stations, rail stations, and other transportation
facilities are required to be accessible by the ADA. The ADA also
establishes [standards for transportation
vehicles]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/vehicles/),
including buses, vans, and rail cars (which are not discussed in this
guide).

#### Exemptions (Religious Entities and Private Clubs)

The ADA does not apply to religious organizations and private clubs,
entities which historically have been exempt from federal civil rights
laws. Places of worship and other facilities controlled by a religious
organization, such as a school or day care center, are not subject to
the ADA Standards. Private clubs may be similarly exempt depending on
their exclusiveness, operations, and other factors. Facilities not
subject to the ADA Standards may still be subject to state or local
access codes.

#### ADA Coverage of Housing

<div class="img-right img-medium">
<img alt="fair housing icon" class="img-grid" src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter1-ada/1ada4.jpg">
<span class="grid-line text-italic" style="font-size: 90%">Information on the Fair Housing Act is available from the Department of Housing and Urban Development at
<a href="https://www.hud.gov/">www.hud.gov</a> or <a href="https://www.fairhousingfirst.org/">www.fairhousingfirst.org</a>, (888)341-7781 (V/TTY).</span>
</div>

Although private residential housing is not covered by the ADA,
government-owned or operated housing and certain privately owned
facilities that provide housing are subject to the ADA and its
accessibility requirements. Government owned or operated facilities may
include public housing, student and faculty housing, employee housing,
nursing homes, temporary housing provided in emergencies, and social
service facilities, such as homeless shelters and halfway houses.

In the private sector, the ADA's coverage of housing is limited to
places of public accommodation, such as social service establishments
and housing provided on or behalf a place of education. The ADA does not
apply to individually owned or leased housing in the private sector not
used as a public accommodation, including single family homes,
condominiums, or apartments. (Many types of multi-family housing in the
private and public sectors are subject to the design requirements of the
Fair Housing Act.) Places of public accommodation located in residential
buildings, such as rental and sales offices, commercial spaces, and
hotel accommodations, are covered by the ADA Standards.

### ADA Regulations

Regulations issued by DOJ and DOT to implement the ADA provide important
information and instructions on using the ADA Standards. The regulations
define the types of facilities covered, set effective dates, and provide
additional detail on certain provisions in the standards. They also
address existing facilities and topics beyond building design, including
access to programs, services, and communication and provision of
auxiliary aids and services.

#### DOJ's ADA Regulations

![DOJ
seal]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter1-ada/1doj.jpg){: .float-right .thumbnail}

DOJ regulations issued under title II of the ADA apply to programs,
activities, and services of state and local governments. DOJ's title III
regulations apply to public accommodations and commercial facilities.
Both regulations contain general nondiscrimination provisions and
address access to programs and services, effective communication,
auxiliary aids and services, and reasonable modifications of policies,
practices, and procedures. Under the title II regulation, state and
local governments must provide program accessibility in existing
facilities, and the under the title III regulation public accommodations
must remove architectural barriers in existing facilities where it is
"readily achievable." In addition, both regulations specify the
accessibility standards applicable to new construction and alterations,
and to the provision of program access or barrier removal.

### DOT's ADA Regulations

![DOT seal]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter1-ada/1dot.png){: .float-right .thumbnail}

DOT's ADA regulations implement the transportation and related
provisions of titles II and III of the ADA. They apply to any public
entity that provides public transportation or intercity or commuter rail
transportation, as well as to any private entity that provides public
transportation or that is not primarily engaged in the business of
transporting people but operates a demand responsive or fixed route
system. They cover both vehicles and facilities and include
nondiscrimination requirements associated with the provision of
transportation services.

### ADA Accessibility Standards

<div class="img-right img-medium">
<img alt="ADA-ABA Accessibility Guidelines cover" class="img-grid" src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter1-ada/1ada-aba.jpg">
<span class="grid-line text-italic" style="font-size: 90%">DOJ's and DOT's ADA Standards are based on the Board's ADA Accessibility Guidelines (2004).</span>
</div>

Both DOJ's and DOT's ADA Standards are based on minimum accessibility
guidelines adopted by the Access Board in 2004, known as the ADA
Accessibility Guidelines. As a result, these two sets of standards are
very similar for the most part. However, each contains additional
requirements that are specific to the facilities covered by the
respective agencies.

#### DOJ's 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design

DOJ's 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design became effective March
15, 2012 and apply to all facilities covered by the ADA except public
transit facilities. This includes state and local government facilities
subject to title II and places of public accommodation and commercial
facilities under title III.

As implemented under title II, the 2010 Standards consist of the
regulatory provisions in 28 CFR §35.151 and appropriate sections of the
Access Board's 2004 ADA Accessibility Guidelines (36 CFR part 1191,
appendices B and D).

For title III of the ADA, the 2010 Standards consist of both the
regulatory provisions in 28 CFR part 36, subpart D, and appropriate
sections of the Access Board's 2004 ADA Accessibility Guidelines (36 CFR
part 1191, appendices B and D).

DOJ's 2010 Standards include provisions not included in DOT's standards
that supplement or modify requirements related to scoping for:

- assembly areas (§221)
- medical care facilities (§223)
- transient lodging, including housing at places of education (§224)
- detention and correctional facilities (§232)
- social service establishments (§233)
- housing provided by state or local governments for sale to individual owners (§233).

</div>

#### DOT's ADA Standards (2006)

DOT's ADA Standards apply to facilities used by state and local
governments to provide designated public transportation and to commuter
and intercity rail stations. The current edition of the standards
applies to new construction and alterations undertaken after November
29, 2006. These standards are very similar to DOJ's 2010 Standards but
include unique provisions concerning:

- accessible route location (§206.3)
- detectable warnings on curb ramps (§406.8)
- bus boarding and alighting areas (§810.2.2)
- rail station platform (§810.5.3).

### How the ADA Standards are Enforced

DOJ's and DOT's ADA Standards are not a building code, nor are they
enforced like one. They constitute design and construction requirements
issued under a civil rights law. The ADA's mandates, including the
accessibility standards, are enforced through investigations of
complaints filed with federal agencies, or through litigation brought by
private individuals or the federal government. There is no plan review
or permitting process under the ADA. Nor are building departments
required or authorized by the ADA to enforce the ADA Standards (some
building departments even include a disclaimer on their plan checks
indicating that ADA compliance is not part of their approval process).
Entities covered by the law ultimately are responsible for ensuring
compliance with the ADA Standards in new construction and alterations.

#### State and Local Access Codes

![code
book]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter1-ada/1codes.png){: .float-right .thumbnail}

Building design and construction, including safety and accessibility, is
largely regulated and enforced by states and local jurisdictions. The
ADA does not intrude upon the authority these governmental entities have
traditionally exercised over the built environment. Most states and many
local jurisdictions have laws or ordinances that address access to the
built environment. Several states have their own accessibility codes,
while others have implemented requirements based on those of the ADA or
adopted access provisions contained in model building codes. The ADA
Standards apply nationally in addition to any applicable state or local
access requirements or codes. An occupancy permit issued by a local
jurisdiction (or a building inspection) does not ensure ADA compliance.
Although local building departments sometimes can waive building code
requirements, a local waiver does not affect the entity's obligation to
comply with the ADA Standards.

The ADA sets up a voluntary process through which a state code can be
certified by DOJ as meeting or exceeding the ADA Standards that apply to
public accommodations and commercial facilities. Certification
facilitates compliance by ensuring that state and local code
requirements are consistent with the ADA accessible design requirements.
This process, in effect, integrates the requirements for accessible
design under the ADA into state or local code enforcement processes.
Under a certified code, design errors are more likely to be caught and
remedied before construction. Also, having a DOJ-certified code offers
rebuttable evidence of compliance with title III of the ADA in response
to a legal challenge under the law concerning accessible facility
construction. Information on ADA state code certification is available
from DOJ and its website at
[www.ada.gov/certcode.htm](http://www.ada.gov/certcode.htm). DOT does
not certify codes as compliant with its ADA Standards for transportation
facilities.

#### Model Building Codes and Industry Standards

![IBC (2003) and ANSI A117.1 Standard
(covers)]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter1-ada/1ibc.jpg){: .float-right .thumbnail}

The Access Board's 2004 ADA Accessibility Guidelines, upon which the
current ADA Standards are based, have been harmonized to a significant
extent with industry standards and model building codes, including the
International Building Code (IBC). The IBC contains application and
scoping provisions for accessibility (in chapters 10, 11 and 34) that
correspond to those in the ADA guidelines (chapters 1 and 2). For
technical provisions, the IBC references a consensus standard developed
through the American National Standards Institute (the ANSI A117.1
standard), which is highly consistent with the technical chapters (3-10)
of the ADA guidelines. There are some substantive differences. For
example, unlike the ADA guidelines, the ANSI standards require an
additional vertical grab bar at water closets, transfer shower stalls,
and tubs. [Detailed comparisons between the 2004 ADA guidelines and the
IBC/ANSI standard]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/ada-ibc-comparison/) are available on the Access Board's
website and the International Code Council's
website at
[www.iccsafe.org](http://www.iccsafe.org/safety/Pages/accessibility-1.aspx).

The ADA Standards also reference several industry standards, including
the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) elevator safety code
and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 72 Fire Alarm Code.
In addition, the ADA Standards reference provisions in the IBC covering
accessible means of egress.

### Chapter 1: Application and Administration

#### Purpose

[[§101]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-101)]

The ADA Standards apply to new construction, alterations, and additions.
While the scoping and technical requirements for new construction also
apply to alterations and additions, provisions and exceptions specific
to alterations or additions are provided throughout the document.

##### Furnishings and Equipment

![office
chair]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter1-ada/1chair.jpg){: .float-right .thumbnail}

The DOJ and DOT ADA Standards, like most building requirements and
codes, apply to those elements that are fixed or built-in. Moveable
elements and furnishings are generally not addressed or covered by the
ADA Standards. DOJ's ADA regulations include requirements that may
impact non-fixed elements, such as providing accessible medical
equipment, including examination tables and chairs, to provide persons
with disabilities effective access to health services. In addition,
placement of non-fixed elements can affect the accessibility of an area
by encroaching into accessible routes and clearances.

{% include recommendation.html
text= "Design spaces so that planned furnishings and moveable elements are accommodated without encroaching into accessible routes and clearances. It is also helpful to consider relevant requirements in the standards when specifying or acquiring moveable furnishings, such as tables, systems furniture, and vending machines to ensure their usability."
%}

Unless specifically permitted, access features required by the ADA
Standards must be fixed or built-in even though portable alternatives
may be available. This includes requirements for assistive listening
systems, visual alarms, shower seats, ramps, and platform lifts. (In
removing barriers to existing places of public accommodation, portable
solutions may be permitted in some cases where permanent solutions are
not readily achievable).

##### Maintenance of Accessible Features

The ADA Standards address the design, but not the maintenance, of
building elements and features. However, it is important that accessible
features be properly maintained in working order. DOJ's and DOT's
regulations require that features of facilities and equipment required
to be accessible be maintained in operable working condition, except for
isolated or temporary interruptions in service due to maintenance or
repairs.

#### Dimensions for Adults and Children

[[§102]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-102)]

![girl using
wheelchair]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter1-ada/1girl.jpg){: .float-right .thumbnail}

The ADA Standards provide technical specifications for building elements
designed specifically for use by children 12 and younger. These
provisions address access for children to:

- drinking fountains (§602)
- water closets and toilet compartments (§604)
- lavatories and sinks (§606) and
- dining and work surfaces (§902).

The ADA Standards also include requirements for play areas (§240 and
§1008) and recommendations (advisory notes) with respect to children's
reach ranges (§301.1) and ramp handrails used primarily by children
(§505.4).

The ADA Standards do not specify where or when elements are to be
designed or constructed for use primarily by children. This
determination is left to other building requirements or regulations,
good practice, client preference, or other factors. The provisions
covering elements designed for children's use (other than those
addressing play areas) are structured as exceptions to specifications
based on adult dimensions. Once the decision is made to design certain
elements based on children's dimensions and to use the exceptions, the
alternate specifications provided in the ADA Standards must be followed.
The ADA Standards do not require provision of additional accessible
elements in order to separately accommodate both children and adults,
although doing so may be advisable in mixed use spaces. For example, in
some restrooms at facilities such as schools and children's museums, it
may be a good idea to provide a wheelchair accessible toilet compartment
for use by adults and another for use by children.

#### Equivalent Facilitation

[[§103]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-103)]

The ADA Standards allow alternatives to specified requirements that
provide substantially equivalent or greater accessibility and usability
as an "equivalent facilitation." The question of whether an alternative
solution is "equivalent" involves considerations as to whether it is
just as, if not more, effective in terms of accessibility, usability,
convenience, and reliability for people with disabilities. For example,
the ADA Standards specify permanent or built-in features for independent
access. Unless otherwise specified, alternatives involving temporary or
portable solutions or requiring assistance from others are not generally
deemed equivalent to the required minimum level of access.

The provision of equivalent facilitation is intended to accommodate good
faith innovations and technological advances not anticipated by the ADA
Standards. It is not to be used as a means to resolve oversights in
design or construction. Understanding the rationale for certain
specifications is often helpful in determining whether an alternative is
equivalent. For example, transfer shower stalls are required to be 36
inches by 36 inches absolute so that grab bars remain within reach from
the seat. A wider transfer shower stall would not qualify as "equivalent
facilitation" because it would make the grab bars less usable from the
seat and less accessible to individuals with disabilities.

DOT's ADA regulations (§37.9) detail the process, procedures and
requirements for seeking a determination of equivalent facilitation for
a public transportation facility subject to DOT's ADA Standards. No
departures from specific provisions of the DOT standards can be made
without a determination issued by the Administrator of the relevant
operating administration (e.g., the Federal Transit Administration, the
Federal Railroad Administration, or the Federal Highway Administration)
with the concurrence of the Assistant Secretary for Transportation
Policy. Requests for official determinations of equivalent facilitation
should be directed to the Federal Transit Administration.

DOJ's ADA regulations do not establish a process for approving or
certifying equivalent facilitation alternatives to requirements of DOJ's
ADA Standards. In the case of DOJ's ADA Standards, the responsibility
for demonstrating equivalent facilitation in the event of a legal
challenge or complaint rests with the covered entity. In pursuing
equivalent facilitation alternatives under DOJ's ADA regulations, it is
good practice to:

- base decisions on sound independent research and reliable data
- involve disability groups and individuals with a variety of disabilities in the process
- document the effort thoroughly, including information and feedback from consulted sources

#### Conventions

[[§104]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-104)]

Most dimensions in the ADA Standards are specified as a minimum,
maximum, or as a range. In a few areas, absolute dimensions are
specified.

##### Construction and Manufacturing Tolerances

A tolerance is an unintended, but permitted (i.e., "tolerated"),
variation from a specified dimension resulting from the process of
construction or manufacture. The ADA Standards recognize conventional
industry tolerances for dimensions not expressed as a range. This
applies to field work, not design work. Tolerances necessary for a
particular manufacturing process are also permitted. Information on
specific tolerances may be available from industry and trade
organizations, code groups and building officials, and published
references.

Many dimensions in the ADA Standards are expressed as a range instead of
an absolute so that designers can allow some room for minor deviations
in construction or manufacturing. Tolerances do not apply to dimensions
specified as a range.

#### Grab Bar Diameter and Clearance

  ![Grab bar diameter 1 1/4 inches to 2 inches (tolerance not allowed) and knuckle clearance 1 1/2 inches absolute (tolerance allowed)]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter1-ada/1gbar.jpg){: .img-large}  
  <div class="img-large-caption">
  Construction or manufacturing tolerances are permitted for the required clearance at grab bars since this is an absolute dimension (1½ inch), but they are not permitted for the grab bar diameter because a range is specified (1¼&Prime; to 2&Prime;).</div>

##### Calculation of Percentages

Some provisions in the ADA Standards specify a minimum number of elements or spaces as a minimum percentage or proportion. Rounding up to the next greater whole number is required where fractions or remainders occur. For example, if the standards require access to at least 5% of an element and a total of 25 are provided, at least 2 must be accessible
(rounding up from 1.25).

In the case of specifications for dimensions or sizes that involve percentages or ratios, rounding down for values less than one half is allowed.

{% include recommendation.html
text= "Dimensions expressed as a range are intended to accommodate deviations in the field. It is good practice to specify accordingly. For example, for the location of wheelchair accessible water closets (16&Prime; to 18&Prime; centerline from side walls or partitions), specifying to the midpoint of the range (17&Prime;) will accommodate any construction variations up to 1&Prime; plus or minus. For dimensions not expressed as an absolute (\"X maximum\" or \"Y minimum\"), specify in a manner that accommodates the expected tolerance within the required dimensions by subtracting the tolerance from the required maximum or adding it to the required minimum."
%}

##### Figures in the Standards

Figures in the ADA Standards are provided only for informational
purposes to illustrate dimensions and requirements contained in the
text. They do not establish enforceable requirements unless specifically
stated otherwise.

#### Referenced Standards

[[§105]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-105)]

The ADA Standards reference industry standards for certain elements,
including automated doors (ANSI/BHMA standards), means of egress (IBC),
fire alarms (NFPA National Fire Alarm Code), elevators and platform
lifts (ASME Safety Code), and play surfaces (ASTM standards).

The specific editions of these documents referenced by the ADA Standards
must be followed. Use of a more recent edition of a referenced standard
is not recognized until DOJ and DOT update their standards to reference
that edition. Compliance with a later edition may be possible under the
provision for "equivalent facilitation" if it is comparable to, or
provides greater accessibility than, the editions currently referenced
by the ADA Standards.

####  Definitions

[[§106]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/#ada-106)]

Many important terms used in the ADA Standards are defined in section 106. DOJ's and DOT's regulations also include definitions that are
relevant to use of the ADA Standards. For example, DOJ's regulations define entities covered by the ADA, such as "places of public
accommodation," or that are exempt from the ADA, such as "religious entities."

Defined terms in referenced standards govern when those terms are not
defined in either the ADA Standards or regulations. Section 106.3 of the
ADA Standards provides that terms not specifically defined in section
106.5, in regulations issued by either DOJ or DOT, or in referenced
standards, shall be defined by collegiate dictionaries in the sense that
the context implies.

### Common Questions

#### How are the ADA standards developed?

![question mark]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}ques.jpg){: .float-right .thumbnail}

The ADA charges the Access Board with the responsibility of developing
guidelines for accessible design that are intended to serve as the basis
for mandatory and enforceable ADA Standards adopted by DOJ and DOT. The
ADA Standards and the Board's guidelines are developed and adopted using
the procedures that apply to the federal rulemaking process. Under this
process, agencies publish proposed language in the Federal Register, and
then provide the public with the opportunity to provide input during a
specified comment period. Often, agencies also hold public hearings
during the comment period. Prior to publication of the final rule,
agencies must review the public comments they have received. They also
must assess the costs and benefits of the new guidelines or standards on
the public, including their impact on small businesses. The same process
must be followed for changes and updates to the guidelines and
standards.

#### Do the ADA Standards override state or local requirements?

No, both the ADA Standards and all applicable state and local
requirements must be satisfied. Where there is a difference, the
standard that provides greater accessibility must be followed.

#### If a state or local authority interprets an accessibility requirement differently than how a comparable requirement in the ADA Standards is interpreted under the ADA (or waives that requirement completely), does this have any bearing on ADA compliance?

No. While state or local authorities may interpret or waive their own
state or local accessibility codes as they see fit, those decisions have
no effect on the obligation to comply with requirements of the
applicable ADA Standards. Covered entities are still required to design,
construct or alter their facilities in compliance with the ADA Standards
even where comparable requirements in a state or local code are
interpreted or applied differently or are waived altogether by the
appropriate state or local official.

#### Is there an official review and approval process under the ADA for alternatives pursued as an "equivalent facilitation"?

There is an official review and approval process under the ADA only for
transportation facilities (and vehicles) subject to DOT's ADA
regulations, which establish a process for determining whether a
specific departure from the specific technical and scoping requirements
provides equal or greater accessibility.

DOJ does not have a mechanism to certify any specific variation from its
2010 Standards as being "equivalent." Proposed alternative designs, when
supported by available data, are not prohibited; but in any ADA title II
or title III investigation, compliance review, or lawsuit, the covered
entity would bear the burden of proving that any alternative design
provides equal or greater access.

#### Can later editions of the industry standards or building codes referenced by the ADA Standards be used?

The specific editions of the industry standards referenced by the ADA
Standards are to be followed until DOJ or DOT revises its ADA Standards
to reference later editions. Compliance with a later edition of a
referenced standard or building code not currently referenced by the ADA
Standards may be possible under the provision for "equivalent
facilitation" if it is comparable to, or provides greater access than,
the referenced editions.
