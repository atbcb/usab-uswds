### V1001 General

**V1001.1 Scope.**  The provisions of Chapter 10 shall apply where required by Chapter 2 or where referenced by a requirement in this document.

**Advisory V1001.1 Scope.**  Unless otherwise modified or specifically addressed in Chapter 10, all other provisions apply to the design and construction of recreation facilities and elements.  The provisions in Section V1001.1 apply wherever these elements are provided.  For example, some passenger vessels may contain a room with exercise equipment to which these sections would apply.

### V1002 Exercise Machines and Equipment

**V1002.1 Clear Deck Space.**  Exercise machines and equipment shall have a clear deck space complying with V305 positioned for transfer or for use by an individual seated in a wheelchair.  Clear deck spaces required at exercise machines and equipment shall be permitted to overlap.

**Advisory V1002.1 Clear Deck Space.**  One clear deck space is permitted to be shared between two pieces of exercise equipment.  To optimize space use, designers should carefully consider layout options such as connecting ends of the row and center aisle spaces.  The position of the clear deck space may vary greatly depending on the use of the equipment or machine.  For example, to provide access to a shoulder press machine, clear deck space next to the seat would be appropriate to allow for transfer.  Clear deck space for a bench press machine designed for use by an individual seated in a wheelchair, however, will most likely be centered on the operating mechanisms.

**Advisory V1005.2 Pool Lifts.**  There are a variety of seats available on pool lifts ranging from sling seats to those that are preformed or molded.  Pool lift seats with backs will enable a larger population of persons with disabilities to use the lift.  Pool lift seats that consist of materials that resist corrosion and provide a firm base to transfer will be usable by a wider range of people with disabilities.  Additional options such as armrests, head rests, seat belts, and leg support will enhance accessibility and better accommodate people with a wide range of disabilities.

**V1005.2.1 Seat Location.**  In the raised position, the centerline of the seat shall be located over the deck surface and 16 inches (405 mm) minimum from the edge of the pool.  The deck surface between the centerline of the seat and the pool edge shall have a slope not steeper than 1:48.

**V1005.2.3 Seat Height.**  The height of the lift seat shall be designed to allow a stop at 16 inches (405 mm) minimum to 19 inches (485 mm) maximum measured from the deck surface to the top of the seat surface when in the raised (load) position.

| [![An elevation drawing shows pool lift seat height to be 16 to 19 inches (405 to 485 mm) measured from the deck surface to the top of the seat surface when in the raised (load) position.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Transportation/Passenger_Vessels/V1005-2-3.jpg)](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Transportation/Passenger_Vessels/V1005-2-3.jpg) |

**V1005.2.5 Footrests and Armrests.**  Footrests shall be provided and shall move with the seat.  If provided, the armrest positioned opposite the water shall be removable or shall fold clear of the seat when the seat is in the raised (load) position.

**EXCEPTION.**  Footrests shall not be required on pool lifts provided in spas.

**V1005.2.6 Operation.**  The lift shall be capable of unassisted operation from both the deck surface and water levels.  Controls and operating mechanisms shall be unobstructed when the lift is in use and shall comply with V309.4.

**Advisory V1005.2.6 Operation.**  Pool lifts must be capable of unassisted operation from both the deck and water levels.  This will permit a person to call the pool lift when the pool lift is in the opposite position.  It is extremely important for a person who is swimming alone to be able to call the pool lift when it is in the up position so he or she will not be stranded in the water for extended periods of time awaiting assistance.  The requirement for a pool lift to be independently operable does not preclude assistance from being provided.

**V1005.2.7 Submerged Depth.**  The lift shall be designed so that the seat will submerge to a water depth of 18 inches (455 mm) minimum below the stationary water level.

**Advisory V1005.2.7 Submerged Depth.**  As pool lifts are required by V1005.2.5 to be equipped with footrests, water depths greater than 18 inches (455 mm) are needed to properly submerge the seat of pool lifts.  To allow the opportunity for someone to provide assistance from a standing position in the water to lift users, it is recommended that a portion of the pools where pool lifts are located have water depths that do not exceed 48 inches (1220 mm).

| [![An elevation drawing shows a pool lift with the surface of the seat submerged to a water depth of 18 inches (455 mm) minimum below the stationary water level.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Transportation/Passenger_Vessels/V1005-2-7.jpg)](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Transportation/Passenger_Vessels/V1005-2-7.jpg) |

**V1005.2.8 Lifting Capacity.**  Single person pool lifts shall have a weight capacity of 300 pounds (136 kg) minimum and be capable of sustaining a static load of at least one and a half times the rated load.

**Advisory V1005.2.8 Lifting Capacity.**  Single person pool lifts must be capable of supporting a minimum weight of 300 pounds (136 kg) and sustaining a static load of at least one and a half times the rated load.  Providing a pool lift with a weight capacity greater than 300 pounds (136 kg) may be advisable.

**V1005.3 Sloped Entries.**  Sloped entries shall comply with V1005.3.

**Advisory V1005.3 Sloped Entries.**  Personal wheelchairs and mobility devices may not be appropriate for submerging in water.  Some may have batteries, motors, and electrical systems that when submerged in water may cause damage to the personal mobility device or wheelchair or may contaminate the pool water.  Providing an aquatic wheelchair made of non-corrosive materials and designed for access into the water will protect the water from contamination and avoid damage to personal wheelchairs or other mobility aids.

**V1005.3.1 Sloped Entries.**  Sloped entries shall comply with V402 except as modified in V1005.3.1 through V1005.3.3.

**EXCEPTION.**  Where sloped entries are provided, the surfaces shall not be required to be slip resistant.

**EXCEPTIONS.  1.**  Handrail extensions specified by V503.10.1 shall not be required at the bottom landing serving a sloped entry.

**2.**  Where a sloped entry is provided for wave action pools, leisure rivers, sand bottom pools, and other pools where user access is limited to one area, the handrails shall not be required to comply with the clear width requirements of V1005.3.3.

**3.**  Sloped entries in wading pools shall not be required to provide handrails complying with V1005.3.3.  If provided, handrails on sloped entries in wading pools shall not be required to comply with V503.
