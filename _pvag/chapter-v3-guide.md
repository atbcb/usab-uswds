### V301 General

**V301.1 Scope.**  The provisions of Chapter 3 shall apply where required by Chapter 2 or where referenced by a requirement in this document.

### V302 Deck Surfaces

**V302.1 General.**  Deck surfaces shall be stable, firm, and slip resistant and shall comply with V302.

**EXCEPTIONS.**  Areas of sport activity shall not be required to comply with V302.

**Advisory V302.1 General.**  A stable surface is one that remains unchanged by contaminants or applied force, so that when the contaminant or force is removed, the surface returns to its original condition.  A firm surface resists deformation by either indentations or particles moving on its surface.  A slip-resistant surface provides sufficient frictional counterforce to the forces exerted in walking to permit safe ambulation.

**V302.2 Carpet.**  Carpet or carpet tile shall be securely attached and shall have a firm cushion, or backing or no cushion.  Carpet or carpet tile shall have a level loop, textured loop, level cut pile, or level cut/uncut pile texture.  Pile height shall be ½ inch (13 mm) maximum.  Exposed edges of carpet shall be fastened to deck surfaces and shall have trim on the entire length of the exposed edge.  Carpet edge trim shall comply with V303.

**Advisory V302.2 Carpet.**  Carpets and permanently affixed mats can significantly increase the amount of force (roll resistance) needed to propel a wheelchair over a surface.  The firmer the carpeting and backing, the lower the roll resistance.  A pile thickness up to ½ inch (13 mm) (measured to the backing, or cushion (e.g., padding) if no backing is provided) is allowed, although a lower pile provides easier wheelchair maneuvering.  If a backing or cushion is used, it must be firm.  Preferably, carpet cushion should not be used because the soft cushioning increases roll resistance.

Carpet Pile Height
| [![Carpet is shown in cross section with a pile height of 2 inch (13 mm) maximum, measured from the backing.](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Transportation/Passenger_Vessels/V302-2.jpg)](https://www.access-board.gov/images/guidelines_standards/Transportation/Passenger_Vessels/V302-2.jpg) |

**V302.3 Openings.**  Openings in deck surfaces shall not allow passage of a sphere more than ½ inch (13 mm) in diameter except as allowed in V407.4.3 and V409.4.  Elongated openings shall be placed so that the long dimension is perpendicular to the dominant direction of travel.

**EXCEPTIONS.  1.**  Vehicle tie-downs that are flush with the deck surface and are not located within an onboard accessible route shall not be required to comply with V302.3.

**2.**  Where the administrative authority determines that larger openings are needed for deck drainage, openings not located within an accessible route shall be permitted to be increased, if the size shall not allow passage of a sphere more than ¾ inch (19 mm) in diameter.

Elongated Openings in Deck Surfaces

### V303 Changes in Level

**V303.1 General.**  Where changes in level are permitted in deck surfaces, they shall comply with V303.

**EXCEPTIONS.  1.**  Areas of sport activity shall not be required to comply with V303.

**2.**  Vehicle tie-downs that are flush with the deck surface and are not located within an accessible route shall not be required to comply with V303.

**V303.2 Vertical.**  Changes in level of ¼ inch (6.4 mm) high maximum shall be permitted to be vertical.

**V303.3 Beveled.**  Changes in level between ¼ inch (6.4 mm) high minimum and ½ inch (13 mm) high maximum shall be beveled with a slope not steeper than 1:2.

**Advisory V303.3 Beveled.**  A change in level of ½ inch (13 mm) is permitted to be ¼ inch (6.4 mm) vertical plus ¼ inch (6.4 mm) beveled.  However, in no case may the combined change in level exceed ½ inch (13 mm).  Changes in level exceeding ½ inch (13 mm) must comply with V405 (Ramps) or V406 (Curb Ramps).

### V304 Turning Space

**V304.1 General.**  Turning space shall comply with V304.

**V304.2 Deck Surfaces.**  Deck surfaces of a turning space shall comply with V302.  Changes in level are not permitted.

**EXCEPTION.**  Slopes not steeper than 1:48 shall be permitted.

**Advisory V304.2 Deck Surfaces Exception.**  As used in this section, the phrase "changes in level" refers to surfaces with slopes and to surfaces with an abrupt rise exceeding that permitted in Section V303.3.  Such changes in level are prohibited in required clear deck spaces, turning spaces, and in similar spaces where people using wheelchairs and other mobility devices must park their mobility aids such as in wheelchair spaces, or maneuver to use elements such as at doors, fixtures, and telephones.  The exception permits slopes not steeper than 1:48.

**V304.3 Size.**  Turning space shall comply with V304.3.1 or V304.3.2.

**Advisory V306.1 General.**  Clearances are measured in relation to the usable clear deck space, not necessarily to the vertical support for an element.  When determining clearance under an object for required turning or maneuvering space, care should be taken to ensure the space is clear of any obstructions.

**V306.2 Toe Clearance.**

**V306.2.1 General.**  Space under an element between the finish deck surface and 9 inches (230 mm) above the finish deck surface shall be considered toe clearance and shall comply with V306.2.

**EXCEPTION.**  Handrails shall be permitted to protrude 4½ inches (115 mm) maximum.

**Advisory V307.2 Protrusion Limits.**  When a cane is used and the element is in the detectable range, it gives a person sufficient time to detect the element with the cane before there is body contact.  Elements located on circulation paths, including operable elements, must comply with requirements for protruding objects.  For example, awnings and their supporting structures cannot reduce the minimum required vertical clearance.
