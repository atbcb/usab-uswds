<h3 id="v301">V301 General</h3>
<h4>V301.1 Scope</h4>
    <p>The provisions of Chapter 3 shall apply where required by Chapter 2 or where referenced by a requirement in this document.</p>
<h3 id="v302">V302 Deck Surfaces</h3>
<h4>V302.1 General</h4>
    <p>Deck surfaces shall be stable, firm, and slip resistant and shall comply with V302.</p>
<p class="text-bold">EXCEPTION</p>
    <p>Areas of sport activity shall not be required to comply with V302.</p>
    <p class="advisory"><span class="text-bold">Advisory V302.1 General.</span> A stable surface is one that remains unchanged by contaminants or applied force, so that when the contaminant or force is removed, the surface returns to its original condition. A firm surface resists deformation by either indentations or particles moving on its surface. A slip-resistant surface provides sufficient frictional counterforce to the forces exerted in walking to permit safe ambulation.</p>
<h4>V302.2 Carpet</h4>
    <p>Carpet or carpet tile shall be securely attached and shall have a firm cushion, or backing or no cushion. Carpet or carpet tile shall have a level loop, textured loop, level cut pile, or level cut/uncut pile texture. Pile height shall be ½ inch (13 mm) maximum. Exposed edges of carpet shall be fastened to deck surfaces and shall have trim on the entire length of the exposed edge. Carpet edge trim shall comply with V303.</p>
    <p class="advisory"><span class="text-bold">Advisory V302.2 Carpet.</span> Carpets and permanently affixed mats can significantly increase the amount of force (roll resistance) needed to propel a wheelchair over a surface. The firmer the carpeting and backing, the lower the roll resistance. A pile thickness up to ½ inch (13 mm) (measured to the backing, or cushion (e.g., padding) if no backing is provided) is allowed, although a lower pile provides easier wheelchair maneuvering. If a backing or cushion is used, it must be firm. Preferably, carpet cushion should not be used because the soft cushioning increases roll resistance.</p>

<h4>V302.3 Openings</h4>
    <p>Openings in deck surfaces shall not allow passage of a sphere more than ½ inch (13 mm) in diameter except as allowed in V407.4.3 and V409.4. Elongated openings shall be placed so that the long dimension is perpendicular to the dominant direction of travel.</p>
<p class="text-bold">EXCEPTIONS</p>
    <ol>
        <li> Vehicle tie-downs that are flush with the deck surface and are not located within an onboard accessible route shall not be required to comply with V302.3.</li>
        <li>Where the administrative authority determines that larger openings are needed for deck drainage, openings not located within an accessible route shall be permitted to be increased, if the size shall not allow passage of a sphere more than ¾ inch (19 mm) in diameter.</li>
