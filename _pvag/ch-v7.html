<h3 id="v706">V706 Assistive Listening Systems</h3>
<h4>V706.1 General</h4>
    <p>Assistive listening systems shall comply with V706.</p>
    <div class="advisory">
    <p><strong>Advisory V706.1 General.</strong>Assistive listening systems are generally categorized by their mode of transmission.There are hard-wired systems and three types of wireless systems: induction loop, infrared, and FM radio transmission.Each has different advantages and disadvantages that can help determine which system is best for a given application.For example, an FM system may be better than an infrared system in some open-air assemblies since infrared signals are less effective in sunlight.On the other hand, an infrared system is typically a better choice than an FM system where confidential transmission is important because it will be contained within a given space.Induction loop systems, however, enable persons who use hearing aids (or cochlear implants) equipped with telecoils to use the system without needing a separate receiver and headset</p>
    <p>The technical standards for assistive listening systems describe minimum performance levels for volume, interference, and distortion.Sound pressure levels (SPL), expressed in decibels, measure output sound volume.Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR or S/N), also expressed in decibels, represents the relationship between the loudness of a desired sound (the signal) and the background noise in a space or piece of equipment.The higher the SNR, the more intelligible the signal.The peak clipping level limits the distortion in signal output produced when high-volume sound waves are manipulated to serve assistive listening devices.</p>
    <p>Selecting or specifying an effective assistive listening system for a large or complex venue requires assistance from a professional sound engineer who is knowledgeable about assistive technology and the communication needs of people with hearing loss.The Access Board has published technical assistance on assistive listening devices and systems (see www.access-board.gov).</p>
    </div>
<h4>V706.2 Receiver Jacks</h4>
    <p>Receivers required for use with an assistive listening system shall include a 1/8 inch (3.2 mm) standard mono jack.</p>
<h4>V706.3 Receiver Hearing-Aid Compatibility</h4>
    <p>Receivers required to be hearing-aid compatible shall interface with telecoils in hearing aids through the provision of neck loops.</p>
    <p class="advisory"><span class="text-bold">Advisory V706.3 Receiver Hearing-Aid Compatibility</span> The telecoil is a circuit installed inside many hearing aids (and cochlear implants).When the hearing aid is set to the telecoil mode, the hearing aid can pick up the electromagnetic energy emitted from the neck loop which is connected to an infrared or FM receiver.Receivers that are not compatible with hearing aids include those connected to ear buds (which may require removal of hearing aids), and earphones and headsets that must be worn over the ear which can create disruptive interference in the transmission and can be uncomfortable for people wearing hearing aids.Some headsets can function as neck loops.An exception is provided in V219.3 regarding the requirement of V706.3 where induction loop systems are installed because a telecoil-equipped hearing aid or cochlear implant serves as a receiver.Where inductive loops are provided, inductive loop receivers should be available to ensure access to people with hearing loss who do not use hearing aids or cochlear implants.</p>
<h4>V706.4 Sound Pressure Level</h4>
    <p>Assistive listening systems shall be capable of providing a sound pressure level of 110 dB minimum and 118 dB maximum with a dynamic range on the volume control of 50 dB.</p>
<h4>V706.5 Signal-to-Noise Ratio</h4>
    <p>The signal-to-noise ratio for internally generated noise in assistive listening systems shall be 18 dB minimum.</p>
<h4>V706.6 Peak Clipping Level</h4>
