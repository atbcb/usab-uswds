<h3>V1001 General</h3>
<p><strong>V1001.1 Scope.</strong>&nbsp; The provisions of Chapter 10 shall apply where required by Chapter 2 or where referenced by a requirement in this document.</p>
<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V1001.1 Scope.</strong>&nbsp; Unless otherwise modified or specifically addressed in Chapter 10, all other provisions apply to the design and construction of recreation facilities and elements.&nbsp; The provisions in Section V1001.1 apply wherever these elements are provided.&nbsp; For example, some passenger vessels may contain a room with exercise equipment to which these sections would apply.</p>
<h3>V1002 Exercise Machines and Equipment</h3>
<p><strong>V1002.1 Clear Deck Space.</strong>&nbsp; Exercise machines and equipment shall have a clear deck space complying with V305 positioned for transfer or for use by an individual seated in a wheelchair.&nbsp; Clear deck spaces required at exercise machines and equipment shall be permitted to overlap.</p>
<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V1002.1 Clear Deck Space.</strong>&nbsp; One clear deck space is permitted to be shared between two pieces of exercise equipment.&nbsp; To optimize space use, designers should carefully consider layout options such as connecting ends of the row and center aisle spaces.&nbsp; The position of the clear deck space may vary greatly depending on the use of the equipment or machine.&nbsp; For example, to provide access to a shoulder press machine, clear deck space next to the seat would be appropriate to allow for transfer.&nbsp; Clear deck space for a bench press machine designed for use by an individual seated in a wheelchair, however, will most likely be centered on the operating mechanisms.</p>
