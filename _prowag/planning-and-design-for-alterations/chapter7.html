<p><em>Barden v. City of Sacramento, CA </em></p>
<p>On January 22, 2004, the court granted final approval of the settlement in Barden v. Sacramento. This case set a nationwide precedent requiring cities and other public entities to make all public sidewalks accessible. As a result of the court's ruling in this case, public entities must address barriers such as missing or unsafe curb cuts throughout the public sidewalk system, as well as barriers that block access along the length of the sidewalks. Following the court victory, the parties reached a settlement addressing all sidewalk barrier issues City-wide. The settlement provides that for up to 30 years, the City of Sacramento will allocate 20% of its annual Transportation Fund to make the City's pedestrian rights-of-way accessible to individuals with vision and/or mobility disabilities. This will include installation of compliant curb ramps at intersections; removal of barriers that obstruct the sidewalk, including narrow pathways, abrupt changes in level, excessive cross slopes, and overhanging obstructions; and improvements in crosswalk access. <a href="http://www.dralegal.org/downloads/cases/barden/usca_opinion.txt">http://www.dralegal.org/downloads/cases/barden/usca_opinion.txt</a></p>

<p><em>Metro Nashville, Davidson County, Tennessee </em></p>
<p>In January 2000, the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County voluntarily contacted the United States Department of Justice to discuss its plans for achieving compliance with Title II of the ADA. A formal agreement was reached between the two parties in July 2000. The Final Settlement Agreement was reached in 2004. Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County has conducted extensive reviews of their policies and procedures and made substantial changes to ensure the integration of accessibility into the activities conducted in the public rights-of-ways. Processes have been developed that are transferable to any state and other local governments as models for complying with ADA obligations and regulations.</p>

This document lists a sampling of common accessibility errors or omissions that have been identified through the DOJ's ongoing enforcement efforts. ADA requirements for new construction and alterations include detailed provisions for elements, spaces, and facilities. Successful accessibility is often measured in inches, so attention to detail can make the difference between achieving access and excluding or injuring someone. When the ADA's minimum requirements are not met, the results can limit or exclude a person with a disability and can be dangerous: <a href="ftp://ftp.nashville.gov/web/gsa/ADA/forms/common_e-o_newconstr-alts_pdftagged.pdf">ftp://ftp.nashville.gov/web/gsa/ADA/forms/common_e-o_newconstr-alts_pdftagged.pdf</a></li>

<p>Designing Accessible Pedestrian Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way Series. This series of four individual courses is intended to provide practicing traffic and highway engineers, planners, and transportation managers with a better understanding of the latest public rights-of-way guidelines developed by the U.S. Access Board, and how they can be applied in better designing sidewalks and intersections to accommodate persons with disabilities. Each of the four course modules is designed to be informative in the area of identifying the needs of persons with disabilities, provide practical engineering approaches to successfully addressing these needs on existing facilities, and serve as catalysts in promoting innovative solutions to similar challenges at future locations.

<p><strong>Planning and Funding Accessible Pedestrian Facilities </strong></p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.ite.org/accessible/accessibleped.asp">www.ite.org/accessible/accessibleped.asp</a>; <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/bikeped/bp-guid.htm">www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/bikeped/bp-guid.htm </a></p>
<p><strong>Funding Availability and Design Philosophy </strong></p>
<p>The combined funding of Federal, state and local government on surface transportation is one of this country's largest domestic spending programs. The funding for pedestrian issues has increased dramatically since 1991. This increase was spurred by transportation legislation, grassroots support, and accessibility policies. Pedestrian projects and programs are eligible for funding in almost every major federal-aid surface transportation category. Transportation legislation, including the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) calls for mainstreaming pedestrian (and bicycle) projects into planning, design, and operation of our nation's transportation system. Transportation facilities must include features that will allow people of all abilities to use them. The federal-aid highway program can work hand-in-hand with the ADA of 1990, which requires all pedestrian facilities be accessible for people with disabilities. Accessibility is not an exclusive or separate issue. Rather, accessibility design is fundamental to the walking environment because all pedestrians with or without disabilities benefit from accessibility design. Accessibility is an intrinsic part of planning, retrofitting, and constructing pedestrian facilities, along with safe accommodation and good design. Accessibility is a safety issue because if a facility is not accessible, then it is not safe for more than 54 million people in this country who have some form of disability. The USDOT's policy on accessibility states, “Accessibility is a civil right. The key function of transportation, at its most fundamental level, is to provide basic mobility to society. It is our responsibility to strive to ensure that transportation systems are not only safe and efficient, but also usable by all-including persons with disabilities.” The USDOT's Accessibility Policy Statement can be reviewed at <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/bikeped/atl.htm">http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/bikeped/atl.htm</a>.</p>
<p>Accessibility requirements are not new and these obligations have been around long before the ADA in 1990. States and localities were first required to place curb ramps at street crossings in 1973 by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Also, the DOJ has ruled that resurfacing a roadway (beyond filling pot holes) is an alteration, thus triggering the requirement to place curb ramps at roadway intersections.</p>
<p><strong>Funding Sources for Pedestrian Projects </strong></p>
<p>Pedestrian projects are broadly eligible for funding from almost all the major federal-aid highway, transit, safety and other programs. The matrix at the end of this section denotes the FHWA and FTA funding programs that can be used to fund pedestrian projects and activities.</p>
<p><strong>Federal-Aid Highway Programs </strong></p>
<p>National Highway System funds may be used to construct pedestrian walkways and facilities on land adjacent to any highway on the National Highway System, including Interstate highways.</p>
<p>Surface Transportation Program (STP) funds may be used for either the construction of pedestrian walkways, or nonconstruction projects (such as maps, brochures, and public service announcements) related to safety. TEA 21 adds “the modification of public sidewalks to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act” as an activity that is specifically eligible for the use of these funds.</p>
<p>Ten percent of each state's annual STP funds is set-aside for Transportation Enhancement Activities (TEAs). The law provides a specific list of activities that are eligible TEAs and this includes “provision of facilities for pedestrians and bicycles, provision of safety and educational activities for pedestrians and bicyclists,” and the “preservation of abandoned railway corridors (including the conversion and use thereof for pedestrian and bicycle trails).” Another 10% of each state's STP funds is set aside for the Hazard Elimination and Railway–Highway Crossing programs, which address pedestrian safety issues. Each state is required to implement a Hazard Elimination Program to identify and correct locations that may constitute a danger to motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Funds may be used for activities including a survey of hazardous locations and for projects on any publicly owned, shared-use path, pedestrian pathway or trail, or any safety-related traffic calming measure.</p>
<p>Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program funds may be used for either the construction of pedestrian walkways or nonconstruction projects (such as maps, brochures and public service announcements).</p>
<p>Recreational Trails Program funds may be used for all kinds of trail projects. Of the funds apportioned to a state, 30% must be used for motorized trail uses, 30% for nonmotorized trail uses and 40% for diverse trail uses (any combination).</p>
<p>Provisions for pedestrians are eligible under the various categories of the Federal Lands Highway Program in conjunction with roads, highways, and parkways. Priority for funding projects is determined by the appropriate Federal Land Agency or Tribal government.</p>
<p>National Scenic Byways Program funds may be used for “construction along a scenic byway of a facility for pedestrians.”</p>
<p>High-Priority Projects and Designated Transportation Enhancement Activities identified by SAFETEA-LU include numerous pedestrian, trail, and traffic calming projects in communities throughout the country.</p>
<p>Safe Routes to School funds are provided to the states to substantially improve the ability of primary and middle school students to walk and bicycle to school safely. The purposes of the program are:</p>
<ol>
<li>to enable and encourage children, including those with disabilities, to walk and bicycle to school;</li>
<li>to make bicycling and walking to school a safer and more appealing transportation alternative, thereby encouraging a healthy and active lifestyle from an early age; and</li>
<li>to facilitate the planning, development, and implementation of projects and activities that will improve safety and reduce traffic, fuel consumption, and air pollution in the vicinity (approximately 2 miles) of primary and middle schools (Grades K-8).</li>
</ol>
<p>Each state administers its own program and develops its own procedures to solicit and select projects for funding. The program establishes two distinct types of funding opportunities: infrastructure projects (engineering improvements) and non-infrastructure related activities (such as education, enforcement, and encouragement programs</p>
<p><strong>Federal Transit Program </strong></p>
<p>Title 49 U.S.C. (as amended by SAFETEA-LU) allows the Urbanized-Area Formula Grants, Capital Investment Grants and Loans, and Formula Program for Other Than Urbanized Area transit funds to be used for improving pedestrian access to transit facilities and vehicles. Eligible activities include investments in “pedestrian and bicycle access to a mass transportation facility” that establishes or enhances coordination between mass transportation and other transportation.</p>
<p>SAFETEA-LU also created a Transit Enhancement Activity program with a one percent set-aside of Urbanized-Area Formula Grant funds designated for, among other things, pedestrian access and walkways.</p>
<p><strong>Highway Safety Programs </strong></p>
<p>Pedestrian and bicyclist safety remain priority areas for State and Community Highway Safety Grants funded by the Section 402 formula grant program. A state is eligible for these grants by submitting a performance plan (establishing goals and performance measures for improving highway safety) and a highway safety plan (describing activities to achieve those goals). Research, development, demonstrations, and training to improve highway safety (including pedestrian safety) is carried out under the Highway Safety Research and Development (Section 403) program.</p>

<p><strong>Self-Evalutions and Transition Plans </strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the self-evaluation is to review jurisdiction/agency policies, practices, and procedures to identify those that may discriminate against or prevent participation of persons with disabilities. Public input, including the participation of residents with disabilities, is part of the self-evaluation process</p>
<p>Process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct an evaluation of current programs, services, and activities as well as employment practices and procedures to ensure they do not discriminate against people with disabilities.</li>
<li>Undertake modifications to any programs, services, activities, or employment provisions that may have the affect of discriminating.</li>
<li>Provide an opportunity for interested groups and individuals with disabilities to provide input on the self-evaluation process.</li>
</ul>
<p>For public entities that have more than 50 employees, the self-evaluation must be kept on file and available for public inspection for at least three years. The self-evaluation plan must include the names of the interested persons consulted, a description of the areas examined, and the problems identified, as well as a description of any modifications made or planned. Additionally, an ADA Coordinator must be appointed to coordinate compliance efforts; a grievance procedure adopted and published; and a transition plan developed identifying structural changes needed to facilities to ensure program accessibility.</p>
<p>The transition plan must identify and schedule all structural modifications that are needed to buildings and facilities to ensure that programs, services, and activities are accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
<p>A 2006 NCHRP project will develop model transition planning recommendations for transportation industry agencies: <a href="http://www.trb.org/TRBNet/ProjectDisplay.asp?ProjectID=1247">http://www.trb.org/TRBNet/ProjectDisplay.asp?ProjectID=1247</a></p>

<p><strong>4R Definitions </strong></p>
<p><em>Reconstruction (4R) Project </em></p>
<p>Reconstruction is work proposed on the approximate alignment of an existing route that meets the geometric criteria for a new facility. Includes new location projects or projects that provide substantial changes in the general geometric character of a highway, such as widening to provide additional through travel lanes, horizontal or vertical re-alignment, etc. Reconstruction work includes bridge replacement work.</p>
<p><em>Rehabilitation (3R) Project </em></p>
<p>Rehabilitation is work proposed to improve serviceability and extend the service life of existing highways and streets and to enhance safety. Work is usually accomplished within the existing right-of-way and does not include the addition of through travel lanes. Work may include the upgrading of geometric features such as roadway widening, minor horizontal re-alignment, and improving bridges to meet current standards for structural loading and to accommodate the approach roadway width.</p>
<p><em>Restoration (2R) Project </em></p>
<p>Restoration is work proposed to restore the pavement structure, riding quality, or other necessary components to their existing cross section configuration. Upgrading roadway components as needed to maintain the roadway in an acceptable condition that may be included in restoration work. The addition of through travel lanes is not permitted under a restoration project.</p>
<p><em>Resurfacing </em></p>
<p>Resurfacing is the application of an additional surface to an existing base pavement or wearing surface to improve the ride, strength, or safety of the pavement.</p>

<p>People with disabilities are unable to participate in the activities of city government, such as public meetings, city functions, and are unable to gain access to the city's various programs and services. If a municipal building such as a courthouse is inaccessible, people with disabilities who use wheelchairs are unable to participate in jury duty, attend hearings, and gain access to other services because doorways are too narrow, restroom facilities are inaccessible, and steps are the only way to get to all or portions of a facility.</p>
<p>Requirement</p>
<p>Title II requires city governments to ensure that all of their programs, services, and activities, when viewed in their entirety, are accessible to people with disabilities. Program access is intended to remove physical barriers to city services, programs, and activities, but it generally does not require that a city government make each facility, or each part of a facility, accessible. For example, each restroom in a facility need not be made accessible. However, signage directing people with disabilities to the accessible features and spaces in a facility should be provided. Program accessibility may be achieved in a variety of ways. City governments may choose to make structural changes to existing facilities to achieve access. But city governments can also pursue alternatives to structural changes to achieve program accessibility. For example, city governments can move public meetings to accessible buildings and can relocate services for individuals with disabilities to accessible levels or parts of buildings. When choosing between possible methods of program accessibility, however, city governments must give priority to the choices that offer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate. In addition, all newly constructed city facilities must be fully accessible to people with disabilities. <br> 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.149, 35.150, 35.151, 35.163.</p>
<p><em>Issue: Curb Ramps </em></p>
<p>Common Problem</p>
<p>City governments often do not provide necessary curb ramps to ensure that people with disabilities can travel throughout the city in a safe and convenient manner.</p>

<p>Without the required curb ramps, sidewalk travel in urban areas is dangerous, difficult, and in some cases impossible for people who use wheelchairs, scooters, and other mobility aids. Curb ramps allow people with mobility impairments to gain access to the sidewalks and to pass through center islands in streets. Otherwise, these individuals are forced to travel in streets and roadways and are put in danger or are prevented from reaching their destination.</p>
<p>Requirement</p>
<p>When streets and roads are newly built or altered, they must have ramps wherever there are curbs or other barriers to enter from a pedestrian walkway. Likewise, when new sidewalks or walkways are built or altered, they must contain curb ramps or sloped areas wherever they intersect with streets or roads. While resurfacing a street or sidewalk is considered an alteration for these purposes, filling in potholes alone will not trigger the alterations requirements. At existing roads and sidewalks that have not been altered, however, city governments may choose to construct curb ramps at every point where a pedestrian walkway intersects a curb, but they are not necessarily required to do so. Under program access, alternative routes to buildings that make use of existing curb ramps may be acceptable where people with disabilities must only travel a marginally longer route. One way to ensure the proper integration of curb ramps throughout a city is to set a series of milestones for curb ramp compliance in the city's transition plan. Milestones are progress dates for meeting curb ramp compliance throughout the municipality. Milestones should occur on a regular basis throughout the course of the transition plan and must reflect a priority to walkways serving government buildings and facilities, bus stops and other transportation services, places of public accommodation, and business districts, followed by walkways serving residential areas. It also may be appropriate for a city government to establish an ongoing procedure for installing curb ramps upon request in both residential and nonresidential areas frequented by individuals with disabilities. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.150(d)(2); 35.151(e). In setting milestones and in implementing a curb cut transition plan for existing sidewalks, the actual number of curb cuts installed in any given year may be limited by the fundamental alteration and undue burden limitations.</p>

<p>Common Problem</p>
<p>City governments often have not conducted thorough self-evaluations of their current facilities, programs, policies, and practices to determine what changes are necessary to meet the ADA's requirements, and have not developed transition plans to implement these changes.</p>
<p>Result</p>
<p>When self-evaluations are not conducted and transition plans not developed, city governments are ill-equipped to implement accessibility changes required by the ADA. Without a complete assessment of a city's various facilities, services, and programs it is difficult to plan or budget for necessary changes, and the city can only react to problems rather than anticipate and correct them in advance. As a result, people with disabilities cannot participate in or benefit from the city's services, programs, and activities.</p>
<p>Requirement</p>
<p>All city governments were required to complete a self-evaluation of their facilities, programs, policies, and practices by January 26, 1993. The self-evaluation identifies and corrects those policies and practices that are inconsistent with Title II's requirements. Self-evaluations should consider all of a city's programs, activities, and services, as well as the policies and practices that a city has put in place to implement its various programs and services. Remedial measures necessary to bring the programs, policies, and services into compliance with Title II should be specified—including, but not limited to: relocation of programs to accessible facilities; offering programs in an alternative accessible manner; structural changes to provide program access; policy modifications to ensure nondiscrimination; and auxiliary aids needed to provide effective communication. If a city that employs 50 or more persons decides to make structural changes to achieve program access, it must develop a transition plan that identifies those changes and sets a schedule for implementing them. Both the self-evaluation and transition plans must be available to the public. <br> 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.105, 35.150(d).</p>
