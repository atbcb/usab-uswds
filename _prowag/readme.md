This directory contains files making up the ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines for the Public Right-of-Way

The About and Preamble files are our typical markdown files using frontmatter, including _title_, _order_ and _permalink_ variables.

The main content is broken into stand-along markdown files **without** frontmatter.
: appendix
: application
: scoping
: technical
: supplement

Files **r0** through **r4** use frontmatter and *include_relative* for their main content.

Frontmatter variables:
: title -- used for left sidebar navigation
: order -- sorts sidebar
: permalink -- defines URL for webpage
