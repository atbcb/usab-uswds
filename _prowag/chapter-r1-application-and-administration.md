### R101 Purpose

#### R101.1 General
This document contains scoping and technical
requirements to ensure that facilities for pedestrian circulation and
use located in the public right-of-way are readily accessible to and
usable by pedestrians with disabilities. Compliance with this document
is mandatory when required by regulations issued by federal agencies
that include accessibility standards for the design, construction, and
alteration of pedestrian facilities in the public right-of-way.

{:.advisory}
**Advisory R101.1 General.** Sections marked as "advisory" contain advisory information related to the preceding section. Advisory sections do not establish mandatory requirements. Some advisory sections reference related mandatory requirements to alert readers about those requirements.

#### R101.2 Effect on Existing Facilities
This document does not address
existing facilities unless the facilities are included within the scope
of an alteration undertaken at the discretion of a covered entity.

{: .advisory}
  **Advisory R101.2 Effect on Existing Facilities.** The Department of Justice regulations implementing Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act contain requirements for state and local governments regarding program accessibility and existing facilities. See 28 CFR 35.150. The Department of Transportation regulations implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act also contain requirements for recipients of federal financial assistance from the Department regarding compliance planning. See 49 CFR 27.11 (c).

### R102 Equivalent Facilitation

The use of alternative designs,
products, or technologies that result in substantially equivalent or
greater accessibility and usability than the requirements in this
document is permitted.

### R103 Conventions

#### R103.1 Conventional Industry Tolerances
Dimensions are subject to
conventional industry tolerances except where dimensions are stated as a
range.

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R103.1 Conventional Industry Tolerances.** Conventional industry tolerances include tolerances for field conditions and tolerances that may be a necessary consequence of a particular manufacturing process. Conventional industry tolerances do not apply to design work.

#### R103.2 Calculation of Percentages
Where the required number of
elements or facilities to be provided is determined by calculations of
ratios or percentages and remainders or fractions result, the next
greater whole number of such elements or facilities shall be provided.
Where the determination of the required size or dimension of an element
or facility involves ratios or percentages, rounding down for values
less than one half is permitted.

#### R103.3 Units of Measurement
Measurements are stated in metric and
U.S. customary units. The values stated in each system (metric and U.S.
customary units) may not be exact equivalents, and each system shall be
used independently of the other.

{: .advisory}
**Advisory R103.3 Units of Measurement.** Users should work entirely within one system of measurement, either metric or U.S. customary units. Combining values from the two systems may result in non-compliance.

floor space or maneuvering space. A line with alternating shot and long
dashes with a (c( and (l( at the end indicate the centerline. A dashed
line with longer spaces indicates a permitted element or its extension.
An arrow is to identify the direction of travel or approach. Gray
shading is used to show an element in elevation or plan. Hatching is
used to show the location zone of elements, controls, or features."

#### R104.2 MUTCD
The portions of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices for Streets and Highways (MUTCD), 2009 Edition, that are
incorporated by reference in this document consist of definitions (see
R105.2) and standard statements, as defined in section 1A.13 of the
MUTCD (see R205, R209, and R306.3).  Guidance, option, and support
statements, as defined in section 1A.13 of the MUTCD, shall be used to
assist in the interpretation of the standard statements. Where there are
differences between this document and the referenced standards, this
document applies. The MUTCD is available on the Federal Highway
Administration website at
