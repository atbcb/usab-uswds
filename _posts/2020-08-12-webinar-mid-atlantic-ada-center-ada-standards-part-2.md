**2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design (Parts I & II)**\
September 17 & 18, 10:30 - 12:00\
Dave Yanchulis, U.S. Access Board

The ADA Accessibility Standards apply to the wide range of facilities covered by the ADA, including places of public accommodation, commercial facilities, and state and local government. This two-part session will provide an overview of the 2010 ADA Standards and review scoping and technical requirements for new construction and alterations with a focus on common sources of confusion. Part I will cover application of the standards and which rooms and spaces must comply, exempt areas and structures, employee work areas, accessible entrances and routes, and operable parts (Chapters 1 – 5). Part II will cover accessible toilet and bathing facilities, signs and other communication features, dining and work surfaces, and sales and service counters (Chapters 6 – 9).

Learning Objectives:

Participants of this session will:

* understand how to correctly apply the ADA Accessibility Standards to sites and facilities in new construction according to application and scoping requirements in Chapters 1 and 2;
* gain an understanding of those features that make entrances, routes, and operable parts accessible in compliance with the ADA Accessibility Standards;
* learn how various requirements in the standards apply and are met in the design of accessible toilet rooms and bathing facilities; and
* learn answers to frequently asked questions and common sources of confusion in the ADA Accessibility Standards.
