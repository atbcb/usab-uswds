This session will review scoping and technical provisions for communication elements and features in the ADA and ABA Accessibility Standards (Chapter 7). These requirements ensure access communication in building elements and systems and cover fire alarm systems, signs, telephones, detectable warnings, assistive listening systems, ATMs and fare machines, and two-way communication systems. Presenters will clarify common sources of confusion and address frequently asked questions about these provisions.
