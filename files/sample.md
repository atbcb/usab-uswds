#### Single (long) paragraph, two spaces after sentence.

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.&nbsp;
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.&nbsp;
We are met on a great battle-field of that war.&nbsp;
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.&nbsp;
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.&nbsp;
But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate.&nbsp; We can not consecrate.&nbsp; We can not hallow this ground.&nbsp;
The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract.&nbsp;
The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.&nbsp;
It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.&nbsp;
It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us.&nbsp;
That from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion.&nbsp;
That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.&nbsp;
That this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom.&nbsp;
And that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
