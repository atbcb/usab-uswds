00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.649
This animation explains requirements in the
ADA and ABA Standards for accessible parking

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.820
and passenger loading zones located at facilities
on sites.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.690
It does not address parking and passenger
loading zones along public streets and sidewalks

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.080
which are the subject of new guidelines the
U.S. Access Board is developing for public

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.830
rights-of-way.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.860
Accessible parking is required for each parking
lot and garage on a site.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.070
The required number of accessible spaces is
based on the total number of spaces in a parking

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.480
facility and is calculated separately for
each lot or garage.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.090
A portion of accessible spaces must be designed
to accommodate vans.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.750
Accessible spaces required for one parking
facility can be located in another if doing

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.560
so results in substantially equal or better
access in terms of travel distances, parking

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.910
fee, or user conveniences.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.660
Even when locating spaces to another facility,
the number of accessible spaces still must

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.580
be determined separately for each parking
facility.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.860
Accessible spaces are to be located on the
shortest accessible route to an accessible

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.979
entrance.

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.049
They must be dispersed among accessible entrances.

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.000
In garages, accessible entrances are required
to serve each direct pedestrian connection

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.249
to a building.

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:25.310
Where direct connections serve multiple levels
of a garage, accessible spaces must be located

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.689
on different levels so that they are dispersed
among accessible entrances.

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:35.290
Van accessible spaces, however, can be clustered
on one level of a parking garage.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.959
In garages without direct pedestrian connections
to a building, all accessible spaces must

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:46.049
be located on the shortest accessible route
to a pedestrian entrance of the garage.

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.560
Accessible spaces must be at least 8 feet
wide and marked to define the width.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.409
An access aisle at least 5 feet wide and as
long as the parking space is required next

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.590
to the space.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.729
The access aisle must be marked.

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.999
The marking method and color is not specified
in the standards, but may be addressed by

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:05.350
state or local regulations.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.770
The access aisle provides room to transfer
to and from vehicles and must be flush with

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.580
the parking space.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.510
Changes in level, other than slopes up to
1:48, are not permitted in either the access

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.280
aisle or the parking space.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:30.620
Curb ramps cannot intrude into any portion
of the access aisle or parking space.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:38.900
Two spaces can share one access aisle.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.850
Users pull in or back into spaces depending
on which side the access aisle is needed.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:56.920
Access aisles cannot overlap vehicular ways.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.880
At entrances with ramps, achieving the shortest
accessible route typically requires locating

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.540
accessible spaces near the entry point of
ramps.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.930
Accessible routes must connect directly to
access aisles.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.740
It is advisable to configure accessible routes
so that users do not have to travel behind

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.960
parking spaces, but this is not required by
the standards.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:22.420
A landing at least 3 feet long is required
at the top of curb ramps to facilitate maneuvering.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.900
Where space for curb ramps is limited, curb
ramps can be configured so that they are parallel

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.430
with sidewalks.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.820
Landings at the bottom of parallel curb ramps
are to have a length of at least 4 feet, 5

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.240
feet preferred.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:48.150
At least one of every six accessible spaces
or fraction of six must be sized for vans.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.819
Van spaces are at least 11 feet wide, 3 feet
wider than regular accessible spaces, to provide

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.709
room for vehicle ramps and lifts.

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.500
This extra width can be added to the access
aisle instead of the parking space which results

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.580
in an access aisle at least 8 feet wide, the
same width as the parking space.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.430
If van spaces are angled, the access aisle
is required to be on the passenger side.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.150
This is the side where vehicle ramps or lifts
typically deploy.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.259
A vertical clearance of at least 98 inches
is required for van spaces and vehicular routes

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:26.150
serving them.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.069
This minimum clearance applies to the vehicular
route from entrances to van spaces, the van

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:38.080
spaces and access aisles, and the vehicular
route to an exit.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.590
Accessible spaces must be labeled by the International
Symbol of Accessibility.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.080
Signs can be installed on posts, suspended
from ceilings, or fixed to walls.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.069
They are required to be at least 5 feet high
measured to the bottom edge so that they remain

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:54.469
visible when spaces are occupied.

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:58.629
Those suspended above circulation paths must
provide headroom clearance of at least 80

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:59.629
inches.

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:05.889
The term “van accessible” is required
on signs designating van spaces and can be

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.099
provided on a separate sign or added to the
main designation sign.

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:13.770
This designation is meant to be informative,
not restrictive.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.300
Those driving cars should keep these spaces
free unless all regular accessible spaces

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.300
are taken.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.789
The standards do not specify other features
of signs, including color, or require other

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.800
content on the sign.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.669
Signs for regular accessible spaces can contain
only the International Symbol of Accessibility

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:31.960
without any text.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.990
However, local jurisdictions may require specific
verbiage.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.949
Designations located on the surface of parking
spaces, even if required by state or local

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.419
regulations, do not satisfy the standards
and cannot substitute for signs that are at

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.409
least 5 feet above the ground.

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:52.919
Pay stations and other devices that serve
accessible parking are subject to criteria

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.839
for operable parts when fixed or built-in.

00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:00.340
These requirements include clear floor space
for a forward or side approach.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.180
Controls and other operable parts must be
located within accessible reach ranges and

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.849
be usable with one hand.

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:12.069
They cannot involve tight grasping, pinching,
twisting of the wrist, or more than 5 pounds

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:16.090
of force to operate.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.039
Devices used from inside vehicles are not
subject to these requirements but should meet

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:24.610
the specifications for operation so that they
are easily usable.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.629
The standards also address access to passenger
loading zones.

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:33.710
Where they are provided, an accessible passenger
loading zone is required within every continuous

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.479
100 linear feet of loading zone space or fraction
thereof.

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:42.669
In general, the requirements apply only if
a passenger loading zone is provided, but

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:47.630
the standards require a compliant passenger
loading zone at several types of facilities.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.490
These include parking facilities with valet
parking, mechanical access garages, and medical

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:58.919
care and long-term care facilities where the
period of stay may exceed 24 hours.

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:03.389
Accessible passenger loading zones provide
a vehicle pull-up space at least 8 feet wide

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:05.279
and at least 20 feet long.

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:10.210
An adjoining access aisle is required, and
it must be marked, at least 5 feet wide, and

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.869
as long as the space.

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:16.889
The access aisle, like those at parking spaces,
must be flush with the pull-up space and cannot

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:18.629
overlap vehicular ways.

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:23.919
No changes in level other than slopes of 1:48
maximum are allowed in either the pull-up

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:26.139
space or the access aisle.

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:31.490
A vertical clearance of at least 114 inches
is required at the vehicle pull-up space and

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:38.839
the access aisle and along vehicle routes
connecting them to vehicle entrances and exits.

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:44.139
Further guidance on accessible parking, passenger
loading zones, and other requirements in the

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:48.789
ADA and ABA Standards is available from the
U.S. Access Board.

00:07:48.789 --> 00:07:53.849
This animation was developed by the U.S. Access
Board in cooperation with the Federal agencies

00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:56.699
that issue the ADA and ABA Standards.
