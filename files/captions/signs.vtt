00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:07.100
This animation explains requirements for signs
in the ADA and ABA Standards.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.480
The standards cover informational signs and
directional signs which must meet requirements

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.950
for visual legibility.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.730
Examples include signs stating “Notice Employees
Only” or those indicating the location of

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.400
elevators.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.150
The standards also address signs that label
permanent rooms and spaces, such as restrooms,

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.380
and require them to be tactile as well as
visually accessible.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.350
Some types of signs are exempted from coverage
and are not required to comply.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.760
These include:
• Temporary signs such as those indicating

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.260
an element is currently out of service;
• Building addresses and directories;

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.839
• Company names and logos;
• Occupant names;

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.299
• Menus;
• Seat and row designations in assembly

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:56.319
areas; and
• Signs in non-public areas of detention

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:58.539
and correctional facilities.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.109
The sign requirements generally apply only
where signs are provided, but the standards

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:08.820
do require the provision of signs to identify
certain accessible elements and spaces, such

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.850
as entrances, restrooms, and parking spaces.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.680
These signs must include specified international
symbols that are depicted in the standards,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.910
including the International Symbol of Accessibility
or ISA.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.660
The required symbol must be either light against
a dark background or dark against a light

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.660
background.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:35.160
The standards do not specify particular colors,
levels of contrast, or sign size, but they

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.330
do require signs to have a non-glare finish.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.190
Accessible entrances of a facility must be
labeled by the ISA if some of the entrances

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.450
are inaccessible.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.980
In addition, directional signs with the ISA
must be provided at inaccessible entrances

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.720
to indicate the location of the nearest accessible
entrance.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.630
Similar provisions apply to the labelling
of accessible toilet rooms and bathing facilities

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.670
when not all are accessible.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.220
Aside from the ISA, additional content for
directional signs is not specified and may

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.259
simply include an arrow.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.889
However, verbiage such as “Accessible Entrance”
or further detail on location, for example

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:18.549
“Use C Street Entrance,” can be helpful.

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.079
Directional signs should be located to prevent
or minimize back-tracking.

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:27.799
A directional sign located at the beginning
of the approach to an inaccessible entrance

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.930
is usually more convenient then one placed
immediately at the entrance.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.659
The ISA also must be used to identify accessible
parking spaces.

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.950
In addition, compliant checkout aisles must
be labelled by the ISA unless all of them

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.730
are accessible.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.540
The International Symbol of Access for Hearing
Loss, which depicts the shape of an ear and

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.769
a diagonal line, is required to indicate the
availability of assistive listening systems

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.750
serving assembly areas.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.629
The International TTY symbol, which shows
a phone handset above a keypad, must be provided

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:08.439
to identify public payphones that are equipped
with TTYs or text telephones and indicate

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.349
their location on directional signs.

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.279
Some signs must be tactile and have both raised
characters and braille in addition to being

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:17.989
visually accessible.

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.750
These requirements apply to signs that identify
“permanent” rooms and spaces, meaning

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.749
those whose function, and thus designation,
is not likely to change over time or without

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.260
significant alteration.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.689
Examples include:
• room and floor numbers or letters;

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:39.079
• room names;
• labels for restrooms, locker rooms, cafeterias,

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:45.139
libraries, conference rooms, break rooms,
mechanical rooms, areas of refuge and other

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.540
permanent rooms and spaces.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.900
In addition, tactile and visual signs must
be provided to label:

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.930
• exit doors at exit stairways, exit passageways,
and exit discharge.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.469
They also are required where:
• signs are provided to identify rail stations

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:03.420
or station entrances.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.959
The standards limit the requirements for tactile
characters to those types of signs that are

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.950
usually located at a door or doorway.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.320
For people with little or no vision, doors
and doorways provide a cue that helps locate

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.140
signs by touch.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.040
Other types of signs, including informational
and directional signs, are not as easy to

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.450
locate tactilely because they are not often
consistently placed in proximity to doors.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.690
Tactile signs must be installed so that the
baseline of tactile characters is within a

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.180
range of 48 inches minimum and 60 inches maximum
above the floor or ground.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:47.500
A required clear floor space that is 18 inches
by 18 inches and centered on the tactile characters

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.690
ensures unobstructed standing space close
to the sign.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.520
This space must be free of any protrusions
to a height of 80 inches.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:03.280
For safety, no door can swing into this space
when open to 45 degrees.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.430
Tactile signs must be on the latch side of
doors.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:12.770
There is no exception where glass walls or
partitions or side lights are present.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:19.060
If there is no wall space at this location,
then signs must be placed on the nearest adjacent

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.640
wall.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.280
Signs can be installed on the push side of
doors that have closers and do not have devices

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.270
that keep the door in an open positon.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:35.700
At double doors with two active leafs, the
sign must be located on the right side.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:41.650
Where one leaf is inactive, the sign is required
on the inactive leaf.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.630
Tactile signs, such as the label for a family
restroom shown here, must be visually accessible

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.920
as well.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:55.240
A non-glare finish is required for the sign,
and characters must contrast from the background

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.910
either light-on-dark or dark-on-light.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:04.970
A minimum level of contrast is not specified,
but the higher the contrast the better, especially

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.940
for people with low vision.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.640
Raised characters must be upper case and sans
serif.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:21.590
They cannot be Italic, oblique, script, highly
decorative, or of other unusual forms.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.850
Characters must be selected from fonts where
the width of the uppercase letter “O”

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:34.220
is between 55% and 110% of the height of uppercase
letter “I.”

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:41.850
Line spacing is required to be 135% to 170%
of the height of raised characters.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:48.530
Where provided, raised borders or decorative
elements must be separated at least 3/8 of

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:54.160
an inch from raised characters so that they
do not interfere with reading by touch.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.070
Characters must be 5/8 of an inch to 2 inches
high based on the uppercase letter “I.”

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:06.070
The stroke thickness, cannot exceed 15% of
the character height.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.780
Characters must be raised at least 1/32 of
an inch.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.030
Spacing between the two closest points of
adjacent raised characters is required to

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:20.920
be at least 1/8 of an inch and no more than
four times the character stroke width.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:26.740
If characters have non-rectangular cross sections,
this spacing range applies to the top of the

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.330
cross section.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:33.900
The spacing at the base of the cross section
must be at least 1/16 of an inch and no more

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.200
than four times the character stroke width.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.850
The content of raised characters also must
be provided in contracted or “Grade II”

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:43.850
braille.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:51.250
Braille is read with a light, sweeping touch,
and braille dots must be domed or rounded.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:56.780
The standards specify the height and diameter
of dots and their spacing within and between

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.370
cells.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.090
Braille must be located below the raised characters.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:08.600
If text is multi-lined, braille is to be located
below the entire text.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:13.810
Braille must be separated by at least 3/8
of an inch from raised characters and, where

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:17.389
provided, raised borders and decorative elements.

00:08:17.389 --> 00:08:23.590
The indication of uppercase letters is to
be used only for proper nouns and names, individual

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:28.850
letters, initials, acronyms, and the first
word of sentences.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:34.650
The international symbols for accessibility,
hearing loss access, and TTYs are the only

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:38.270
pictograms mandated by the standards.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:42.169
Requirements apply to other pictograms only
where they are provided.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:47.900
If a pictogram is used to label a permanent
room or space, it must be on a field at least

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.440
6 inches high as shown here on a family restroom
sign.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.310
This measurement applies to the field, not
the pictogram.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:01.550
The raised and braille text descriptors must
be located directly below, but not within,

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.320
the pictogram field.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:08.120
The pictogram itself is not required to be
raised.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:13.630
Pictograms and their field must have a non-glare
finish and provide light-on-dark or dark-on-light

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.210
contrast.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:20.560
The requirements for the field height and
text descriptors do not apply to informational

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.790
pictograms, such as the international symbol
of accessibility, that may be included on

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.340
a sign.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.320
This is an important distinction.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:33.640
Only those pictograms that identify a permanent
room or space must be on a field at least

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.790
6 inches high and include tactile text descriptors.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:43.820
Examples include pictograms that label restrooms,
stairways, and cafeterias.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:48.740
Pictograms that do not specifically label
a room or space but instead provide information

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:54.130
about it, or direction to it, are not subject
to the requirements for field height or text

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:55.620
description.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:00.840
In addition to the international symbol of
accessibility, other examples of these pictograms

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:06.700
include the TTY symbol with a directional
arrow, and icons that prohibit food and drink

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.290
or that indicate hazardous materials.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:16.270
Signs that provide information about, or direction
to, interior spaces and facilities must meet

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:21.210
requirements for visual access but are not
required to be tactile.

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:26.440
These specifications are slightly different
than the visual requirements for tactile signs.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:31.130
The baseline of visual characters must be
at least 40 inches above the finish floor

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:32.770
or ground.

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:38.150
Signs located above circulation paths must
provide a headroom clearance of at least 80

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.150
inches.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:45.630
A non-glare finish is required, and characters
must contrast from the background either light-on-dark

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.520
or dark-on-light.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.710
In this example of a sign stating “Visitors
must sign in,” a low level of contrast between

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:58.460
the character and background colors is not
as readable as a higher level of contrast.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:03.060
Unlike tactile characters, visual characters
can be upper and lower case.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:10.930
They cannot be italic, oblique, script, highly
decorative, or of other unusual forms.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:18.140
Line spacing is required to be 135% to 170%
of the character height.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:24.850
The stroke thickness is required to be from
10% to 30% of the height of the uppercase

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.140
“I.”

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:31.791
The space between the closest points of adjacent
characters in the same word must be 10% to

00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:34.070
35% of this height.

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:37.380
This does not apply to spaces between words.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:44.230
The character width is based on the uppercase
letter “O” and must be from 55% to 110%

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:46.610
of the character height.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:51.060
The minimum character height, which is based
on the uppercase letter “I,” is determined

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:55.130
by the height of the message on the sign and
the viewing distance.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:12:00.740
Where the baseline of visual characters is
between 40 inches and 70 inches above the

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:06.020
finish floor or ground, and the horizontal
viewing distance is under 6 feet, the character

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.130
height must be at least 5/8 of an inch.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:13.710
If the viewing distance, as determined by
any fixed obstruction that prevents a closer

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:20.060
approach to the sign, is 6 feet or more, the
character height is increased 1/8 of an inch

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:24.250
for every additional foot of viewing distance
over 6 feet.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:29.600
If characters are located above 70 inches
to a height of 120 inches, they must be at

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:35.540
least 2 inches high where the viewing distance
is less than 15 feet.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:39.890
If the viewing distance is greater, then the
minimum character height must be increased

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:46.260
1/8 of an inch for every foot of additional
viewing distance above 15 feet.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:50.960
Characters more than 10 feet above the floor
or ground must be at least 3 inches high if

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.070
the viewing distance is under 21 feet.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:58.330
Where the viewing distance is greater, the
minimum character height is increased 1/8

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:03.550
of an inch for every foot of viewing distance
above 21 feet.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:08.390
Content on some signs may be subject to different
requirements in the standards.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:13.850
This sign, for example, notes the name and
title of an office occupant, “Jill Smith,

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:14.850
Director.”

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:20.210
This portion of the sign is not required to
meet any specifications since occupant names

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:21.480
are exempt.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:26.410
Below the name and title is the term “Accounting
Department” which, in this example, is considered

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:30.570
informational and subject to requirements
for visual characters.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:36.339
Beneath this is noted the room number “403”
which serves as the label of a permanent room

00:13:36.339 --> 00:13:42.250
or space and must meet requirements for visual
and raised characters, including braille.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:47.390
The other content of the sign can be tactile
as well, but this is not required.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:52.320
The requirements for visual characters and
for tactile characters can be satisfied on

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.080
separate signs.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:58.960
In fact, duplicate signs are necessary to
label certain exits.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:04.510
Life safety and building codes address the
visibility and illumination of exit signs.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:10.000
These requirements typically must be met separately
from the tactile signs required by the ADA

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:17.580
and ABA Standards at exit doors serving exit
stairways, exit passageways, and exit discharge.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:22.800
Where raised and visual characters are provided
on separate signs, the tactile sign does not

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.470
need to meet requirements for finish and contrast.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:32.620
Also, raised characters can be one half inch
high instead of 5/8 of an inch.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:38.330
Further guidance on signs and other requirements
in the ADA and ABA Standards is available

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.620
from the U.S. Access Board.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:46.480
This animation was developed by the U.S. Access
Board in cooperation with the Federal agencies

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.920
that issue the ADA and ABA Standards.
