00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.900
This animation explains requirements in

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.240
the ADA and ABA Standards

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.800
for sales and counters, check-out aisles,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.840
and food service lines.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.240
The standards apply to all types of counters

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.680
where purchases and other transactions

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.340
are made and services are provided.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.480
Examples include:

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.960
sales counters of all types

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.040
reception and concierge counters

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.480
information counters

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.620
registration and check-in counters

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.600
counters at bank teller windows and ticket windows

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.100
customer service counters

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.900
ordering, pick-up and drop-off counters

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.220
and other types of service or sales counters

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.640
Display or exhibit counters are covered

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.780
only if they also function as a sales or service counter.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.160
Access is required to at least

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.680
one of each type of counter provided.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.620
If one continuous counter serves

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.340
multiple functions at different sections,

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.700
access is required to each type of function.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.860
Where counters are dispersed throughout a facility,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.160
accessible counters must be dispersed as well.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.260
The surface of accessible counters is limited

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.860
to a height of 36 inches.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.420
The accessible surface must be integral to

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.380
the counter and extend the full depth of

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.160
the counter top for customer use.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.140
Folding or pull-out shelves cannot

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.920
substitute for accessible counter surfaces

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.840
in new construction or alterations.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.260
Because of the relatively brief nature of

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.460
most sales or service transactions,

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.400
the standards permit access for

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.320
either a forward approach or a parallel approach.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.320
Forward approach access provides

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.280
knee and toe space below the counter so that

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.260
people using wheelchairs can roll beneath.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.660
Clear floor space at least 48 inches deep

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.240
must extend from 17 to 25 inches

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.620
below the counter.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.760
Both the accessible counter and

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.440
the clear floor space are required to be

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.880
at least 30 inches wide.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.400
Other sections of the counter

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.480
can be higher than 36 inches.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.120
Knee space 27 inches high minimum

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.340
must extend at least 8 inches

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.880
from the leading edge of the counter.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.640
Beyond this depth, the clearance can reduce

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.380
to 9 inches over a 3-inch span.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.040
Toe space at least 9 inches high extends 6 inches.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.220
No protrusions or obstructions are permitted

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.200
within the knee and toe space or

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.240
the rest of the clear floor space.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.780
If the clear floor space is confined on three sides

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.620
and located in a recess more than 2 feet deep,

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.520
then it must be at least 36 inches wide

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.920
instead of 30 inches to allow more

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.340
room for maneuvering.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.500
For a parallel approach, the accessible portion

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.180
of counter surface must be at least 36 inches long.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.000
If a counter is not this long,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.960
it does not have to be lengthened to 36 inches

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.760
but must be accessible for its full length.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.160
The 30-inch by 48-inch clear floor space

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.240
must be parallel to the counter

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.740
and abut the counter's leading edge.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.720
Shelves, displays, and other elements

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.160
cannot obstruct the clear floor space

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.580
or offset it from the leading edge of the counter.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.900
If the clear floor space is confined on three sides

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.340
and recessed more than 15 inches,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.900
the length must be at least 60 inches

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.620
instead of 48 inches to ease maneuvering into it.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.560
The open side must remain unobstructed.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.900
It is important that accessible portions of counters

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.540
be kept clear of merchandise, displays,

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.720
and other objects.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.820
Accessible surfaces can be integrated

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.300
with higher sections for standees in the same counter.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.840
This check-in counter provides

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.620
an accessible surface with forward approach access

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.860
between two higher sections of counter.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.580
The accessible section of counter

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.060
must be as deep or deeper than the higher sections.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.020
This accessible counter is long enough

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.940
and has sufficient clear floor space

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.340
to also accommodate parallel approaches

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.820
which is helpful for people

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.140
who use scooters and other devices with front tillers.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.680
These requirements also apply to counters

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.660
at teller windows, ticket windows, and service windows.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.180
While the counter height is limited to 36 inches,

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.219
the standards do not specify the height

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.720
of service windows.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.180
A maximum height of 43 inches

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.540
measured to the bottom of the window,

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.400
as required for vision lights at doors,

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.760
is advisable to provide adequate sight lines.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.500
If security glazing is provided at a counter,

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.180
a means of facilitating voice communication is required.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.800
Acceptable methods include grilles, slats,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.360
talk-through baffles, handsets and intercoms.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.200
Grilles or baffles at accessible counters

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.499
should be at heights that are convenient to

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:58.480
use from a seated position,

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.120
but their location is not specified in the standards.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.920
Buttons and other controls for intercoms

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.540
and similar devices, where provided,

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.560
must comply as operable parts and be located

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.840
within accessible reach range.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.280
If a telephone handset is provided,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.260
it must have compliant volume control.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.260
Counters surfaces that project into circulation paths

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.309
from walls can be hazardous to people

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:25.700
with vision impairments if their leading edge

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.500
is above 27 inches and outside of cane sweep.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.080
Those that protrude no more than 4 inches

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.780
into a circulation path,

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.340
such as a counter at a service window,

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.860
do not require further treatment.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.980
Otherwise, counters can be recessed in an alcove

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.465
or they can be partially enclosed

00:05:43.465 --> 00:05:45.940
so that they are detectable

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.500
within the 27 inch high maximum cane sweep.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.760
The leading edge of the counter cannot project

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.339
more than 4 inches from the detectable portion

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.840
that is within cane sweep.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.460
Side panels provide a solution that accommodates

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.660
access for a forward approach.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.660
Waiting lines that serve accessible counters

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.880
or check-out aisles, where provided,

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.740
must meet requirements for accessible routes.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.400
This applies to waiting lines defined by fixed posts,

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.100
stanchions, partitions or other elements,

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.940
but the standards also can be used to ensure access

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.280
to waiting lines with movable elements.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.120
Accessible routes must have a

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.600
continuous clear width of 36 inches.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.400
The clear width can be reduced to 32 inches

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.020
at points for a distance not exceeding 2 feet.

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:35.900
Segments with a clear width below 36 inches

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.520
must be separated by at least 4 feet.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.980
180-degree turns around obstructions require

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.460
additional clear width to facilitate maneuvering.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.580
One option is to provide a clear width of

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.840
60 inches at the turn.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.860
Alternatively, the width at the turn can be

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.960
48 inches minimum if both connecting routes

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.780
are at least 42 inches wide.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.320
Stanchions and other elements cannot reduce

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.680
the minimum clear width at turns.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.280
Turns around obstructions that are at least 4 feet long

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.860
do not require a clear width greater than 36 inches.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.389
The standards also cover access to check-out aisles.

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:26.460
A table specifies the number of check-out aisles

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.600
for each function that must be accessible.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.280
As with counters, accessible check-out aisles

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.640
must be dispersed throughout a facility where

00:07:34.649 --> 00:07:37.409
check-out aisles are dispersed.

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:39.600
The International Symbol of Accessibility

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.120
or ISA is required to label accessible check-out aisles

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.520
unless all check-out aisles are accessible.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.980
If signs are provided to identify check-out aisles

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.100
by number, letter, or function, the ISA

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.880
must be provided in the same location.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.020
Check-out aisles must meet all applicable

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.239
requirements for accessible routes.

00:07:59.239 --> 00:08:01.620
It is important that shelves, displays,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.440
and other elements not reduce

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.100
the minimum clear width.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.800
The counter surface height cannot exceed 38 inches,

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.159
and edge protection on the aisle side

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.900
is limited to a height of 2 inches.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.260
If check writing surfaces are provided,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.600
they must be located within a height of

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.940
28 to 34 inches above the floor.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.180
Those that easily pull out or pivot can facilitate access.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.660
Operable parts of point of sale terminals,

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.900
card readers, and similar devices must comply

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.420
and be located within accessible reach ranges.

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.920
Devices that are easy to adjust and tilt

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.900
will facilitate use and can improve

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.440
the visibility of displays and buttons.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.220
A height for visibility is not specified for these devices,

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.760
but the standard eye level range of a person

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.340
using a wheelchair is approximately 43 to 51 inches.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.360
In addition to counters and check-out aisles,

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.920
the standards also cover food service lines.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.780
In this example of a restaurant with

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.560
take-out or eat-in options,

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.500
customers queue at a station to place orders.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.060
This is one type of service counter in the facility

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.819
that must be accessible and provide

00:09:09.819 --> 00:09:11.620
access for a parallel approach,

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.680
as seen here,

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.399
or a forward approach.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.960
The waiting line must comply as an accessible route.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.300
Where the meal preparation area is intended

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.920
to be visible to customers,

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.140
it should be equally visible to patrons with disabilities

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.060
although this is not addressed by the standards.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.440
If tray slides are provided,

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.700
they must be at a height of 28 to 34 inches

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.120
above the floor measured to the top.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.900
A separate counter that is provided for picking up orders

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.360
represents another type of counter

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.240
that must be accessible.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.320
The counter shown here

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.220
provides forward approach access,

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.000
but there also is sufficient space for a parallel approach.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.560
If self-service shelves are provided,

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.740
at least 50%, but no fewer than one,

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.040
of each type must be within accessible reach range.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.540
For unobstructed reaches,

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.780
the range is 15 inches minimum

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.320
to 48 inches maximum in height.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.280
Access is also required to the separate payment counter

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.620
which represents another type of counter.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.040
Operable parts of soda fountains

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.460
and other food and beverage dispensers that are fixed

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.160
must be usable with one hand and not require

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.180
tight grasping, pinching, twisting of the wrist,

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.360
or more than 5 pounds force to operate.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.920
They also must be located

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.360
within accessible reach range.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.720
For a side reach, the 48-inch maximum height

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.080
is permitted to a reach depth up to 10 inches

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.400
measured form the clear floor space.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.720
If the reach depth exceeds 10 inches,

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.060
the high side reach is reduced to 46 inches maximum.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.699
The side reach depth cannot exceed 24 inches.

00:11:04.699 --> 00:11:08.100
For forward reaches, the 48-inch maximum applies

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.130
to reach depths up to 20 inches measured to

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:14.020
the leading edge of a counter or other obstruction.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.600
If the reach depth is greater than 20 inches
up

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.540
to the maximum 25-inch depth permitted,

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.149
the maximum reach is limited to 44 inches.

00:11:24.149 --> 00:11:26.840
Knee and toe space beneath obstructions

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.640
must extend to or beyond the reach depth.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.700
Fixed devices that dispense condiments,

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.740
tableware, and dinnerware,

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.820
also must comply and be located

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.180
within accessible reach range.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.860
Further guidance on sales and service counters,

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.140
check-out aisles, and food service lines

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.800
and other requirements in the ADA and ABA Standards

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.780
is available from the U.S. Access Board.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.240
This animation was developed

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.780
by the U.S. Access Board in cooperation

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.620
with the Federal agencies that issue

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.260
the ADA and ABA Standards.
