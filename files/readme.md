This directory contains PDF versions of our standards, guidelines, guidance documents, and committee reports.

Please keep in mind:
- Files **must not** contain spaces.
- Files **must not** contain puctuation other than dashes or underscores.
- Files _should_ not contain both dashes and underscores.
- Filenames _should_ be all lowercase.
- Shorter filesnames are preferable, even though that means they are less descriptive.
- _If_ the the filename has date, put the date at the end, and use a format so that year/month/day is unambiguous and sorts correctly.  E.g.:  2001-02-03 _not_ 02-03-01
