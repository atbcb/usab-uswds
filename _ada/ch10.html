<p id="a10011">1001.1 Scope.&nbsp; The provisions of Chapter 10 shall apply where required by Chapter 2 or where referenced by a requirement in this document.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory 1001.1 Scope.&nbsp; Unless otherwise modified or specifically addressed in Chapter 10, all other ADAAG provisions apply to the design and construction of recreation facilities and elements.&nbsp; The provisions in Section 1001.1 apply wherever these elements are provided.&nbsp; For example, office buildings may contain a room with exercise equipment to which these sections would apply.</p>
<h3 id="a1002"><a name="1002 Amusement Rides"></a>1002 Amusement Rides</h3>
<p id="a10021">1002.1 General.&nbsp; Amusement rides shall comply with 1002.</p>
<p id="a10022">1002.2 Accessible Routes.&nbsp; Accessible routes serving amusement rides shall comply with Chapter 4.</p>
<p>EXCEPTIONS:&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; In load or unload areas and on amusement rides, where compliance with 405.2 is not structurally or operationally feasible, ramp slope shall be permitted to be 1:8 maximum.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; In load or unload areas and on amusement rides, handrails provided along walking surfaces complying with 403 and required on ramps complying with 405 shall not be required to comply with 505 where compliance is not structurally or operationally feasible.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory 1002.2 Accessible Routes Exception 1.&nbsp; Steeper slopes are permitted on accessible routes connecting the amusement ride in the load and unload position where it is “structurally or operationally infeasible.” In most cases, this will be limited to areas where the accessible route leads directly to the amusement ride and where there are space limitations on the ride, not the queue line.&nbsp; Where possible, the least possible slope should be used on the accessible route that serves the amusement ride.</p>
<p id="a10023">1002.3 Load and Unload Areas.&nbsp; A turning space complying with 304.2 and 304.3 shall be provided in load and unload areas.</p>
<p id="a10024">1002.4 Wheelchair Spaces in Amusement Rides.&nbsp; Wheelchair spaces in amusement rides shall comply with 1002.4.</p>
<p id="a100241">1002.4.1 Floor or Ground Surface.&nbsp; The floor or ground surface of wheelchair spaces shall be stable and firm.</p>
<p id="a100242">1002.4.2 Slope.&nbsp; The floor or ground surface of wheelchair spaces shall have a slope not steeper than 1:48 when in the load and unload position.</p>
<p id="a100243">1002.4.3 Gaps.&nbsp; Floors of amusement rides with wheelchair spaces and floors of load and unload areas shall be coordinated so that, when amusement rides are at rest in the load and unload position, the vertical difference between the floors shall be within plus or minus 5/8 inches (16 mm) and the horizontal gap shall be 3 inches (75 mm) maximum under normal passenger load conditions.</p>
<p>EXCEPTION:&nbsp; Where compliance is not operationally or structurally feasible, ramps, bridge plates, or similar devices complying with the applicable requirements of 36 CFR 1192.83(c) shall be provided.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory 1002.4.3 Gaps Exception.&nbsp; 36 CFR 1192.83© ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Transportation Vehicles – Light Rail Vehicles and Systems – Mobility Aid Accessibility is available at&nbsp;www.access-board.gov.&nbsp; It includes provisions for bridge plates and ramps that can be used at gaps between wheelchair spaces and floors of load and unload areas.</p>
<p id="a100244">1002.4.4 Clearances.&nbsp; Clearances for wheelchair spaces shall comply with 1002.4.4.</p>
<p>EXCEPTIONS: 1.&nbsp; Where provided, securement devices shall be permitted to overlap required clearances.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Wheelchair spaces shall be permitted to be mechanically or manually repositioned.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Wheelchair spaces shall not be required to comply with 307.4.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory 1002.4.4 Clearances Exception 3.&nbsp; This exception for protruding objects applies to the ride devices, not to circulation areas or accessible routes in the queue lines or the load and unload areas.</p>
<p id="a1002441">1002.4.4.1 Width and Length.&nbsp; Wheelchair spaces shall provide a clear width of 30 inches (760 mm) minimum and a clear length of 48 inches (1220 mm) minimum measured to 9 inches (230 mm) minimum above the floor surface.</p>
<p id="a1002442">1002.4.4.2 Side Entry.&nbsp; Where wheelchair spaces are entered only from the side, amusement rides shall be designed to permit sufficient maneuvering clearance for individuals using a wheelchair or mobility aid to enter and exit the ride.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory 1002.4.4.2 Side Entry.&nbsp; The amount of clear space needed within the ride, and the size and position of the opening are interrelated.&nbsp; A 32 inch (815 mm) clear opening will not provide sufficient width when entered through a turn into an amusement ride.&nbsp; Additional space for maneuvering and a wider door will be needed where a side opening is centered on the ride.&nbsp; For example, where a 42 inch (1065 mm) opening is provided, a minimum clear space of 60 inches (1525 mm) in length and 36 inches (915mm) in depth is needed to ensure adequate space for maneuvering.</p>
<p id="a1002443">1002.4.4.3 Permitted Protrusions in Wheelchair Spaces.&nbsp; Objects are permitted to protrude a distance of 6 inches (150 mm) maximum along the front of the wheelchair space, where located 9 inches (230 mm) minimum and 27 inches (685 mm) maximum above the floor or ground surface of the wheelchair space.

<p id="a100245">1002.4.5 Ride Entry.&nbsp; Openings providing entry to wheelchair spaces on amusement rides shall be 32 inches (815 mm) minimum clear.</p>
<p id="a100246">1002.4.6 Approach.&nbsp; One side of the wheelchair space shall adjoin an accessible route when in the load and unload position.</p>
<p id="a100247">1002.4.7 Companion Seats.&nbsp; Where the interior width of the amusement ride is greater than 53 inches (1345 mm), seating is provided for more than one rider, and the wheelchair is not required to be centered within the amusement ride, a companion seat shall be provided for each wheelchair space.</p>
<p id="a1002471">1002.4.7.1 Shoulder-to-Shoulder Seating.&nbsp; Where an amusement ride provides shoulder-to-shoulder seating, companion seats shall be shoulder-to-shoulder with the adjacent wheelchair space.</p>
<p>EXCEPTION:&nbsp; Where shoulder-to-shoulder companion seating is not operationally or structurally feasible, compliance with this requirement shall be required to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p id="a10025">1002.5 Amusement Ride Seats Designed for Transfer.&nbsp; Amusement ride seats designed for transfer shall comply with 1002.5 when positioned for loading and unloading.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory 1002.5 Amusement Ride Seats Designed for Transfer.&nbsp; The proximity of the clear floor or ground space next to an element and the height of the element one is transferring to are both critical for a safe and independent transfer.&nbsp; Providing additional clear floor or ground space both in front of and diagonal to the element will provide flexibility and will increase usability for a more diverse population of individuals with disabilities.&nbsp; Ride seats designed for transfer should involve only one transfer.&nbsp; Where possible, designers are encouraged to locate the ride seat no higher than 17 to 19 inches (430 to 485 mm) above the load and unload surface.&nbsp; Where greater distances are required for transfers, providing gripping surfaces, seat padding, and avoiding sharp objects in the path of transfer will facilitate the transfer.</p>
<p id="a100251">1002.5.1 Clear Floor or Ground Space.&nbsp; A clear floor or ground space complying with 305 shall be provided in the load and unload area adjacent to the amusement ride seats designed for transfer.</p>
<p id="a100252">1002.5.2 Transfer Height.&nbsp; The height of amusement ride seats designed for transfer shall be 14 inches (355 mm) minimum and 24 inches (610 mm) maximum measured from the surface of the load and unload area.</p>
<p id="a100253">1002.5.3 Transfer Entry.&nbsp; Where openings are provided for transfer to amusement ride seats, the openings shall provide clearance for transfer from a wheelchair or mobility aid to the amusement ride seat.</p>
<p id="a100254">1002.5.4 Wheelchair Storage Space.&nbsp; Wheelchair storage spaces complying with 305 shall be provided in or adjacent to unload areas for each required amusement ride seat designed for transfer and shall not overlap any required means of egress or accessible route.</p>
<p id="a10026">1002.6 Transfer Devices for Use with Amusement Rides.&nbsp; Transfer devices for use with amusement rides shall comply with 1002.6 when positioned for loading and unloading.</p>
<div class="advisory">
<p class="first">Advisory 1002.6 Transfer Devices for Use with Amusement Rides.&nbsp; Transfer devices for use with amusement rides should permit individuals to make independent transfers to and from their wheelchairs or mobility devices.&nbsp; There are a variety of transfer devices available that could be adapted to provide access onto an amusement ride.&nbsp; Examples of devices that may provide for transfers include, but are not limited to, transfer systems, lifts, mechanized seats, and custom designed systems.&nbsp; Operators and designers have flexibility in developing designs that will facilitate individuals to transfer onto amusement rides.&nbsp; These systems or devices should be designed to be reliable and sturdy.</p>
<p class="last">Designs that limit the number of transfers required from a wheelchair or mobility device to the ride seat are encouraged.&nbsp; When using a transfer device to access an amusement ride, the least number of transfers and the shortest distance is most usable.&nbsp; Where possible, designers are encouraged to locate the transfer device seat no higher than 17 to 19 inches (430 to 485 mm) above the load and unload surface.&nbsp; Where greater distances are required for transfers, providing gripping surfaces, seat padding, and avoiding sharp objects in the path of transfer will facilitate the transfer.&nbsp; Where a series of transfers are required to reach the amusement ride seat, each vertical transfer should not exceed 8 inches (205 mm).</p>
</div>
<p id="a100261">1002.6.1 Clear Floor or Ground Space.&nbsp; A clear floor or ground space complying with 305 shall be provided in the load and unload area adjacent to the transfer device.</p>
<p id="a100262">1002.6.2 Transfer Height.&nbsp; The height of transfer device seats shall be 14 inches (355 mm) minimum and 24 inches (610 mm) maximum measured from the load and unload surface.</p>
<p id="a100263">1002.6.3 Wheelchair Storage Space.&nbsp; Wheelchair storage spaces complying with 305 shall be provided in or adjacent to unload areas for each required transfer device and shall not overlap any required means of egress or accessible route.</p>
<h3 id="a1003"><a name="1003 Recreational Boating Facilities"></a>1003 Recreational Boating Facilities</h3>
<p id="a10031">1003.1 General.&nbsp; Recreational boating facilities shall comply with 1003.</p>
<p id="a10032">1003.2 Accessible Routes.&nbsp; Accessible routes serving recreational boating facilities, including gangways and floating piers, shall comply with Chapter 4 except as modified by the exceptions in 1003.2.</p>
<p id="a100321">1003.2.1 Boat Slips.&nbsp; Accessible routes serving boat slips shall be permitted to use the exceptions in 1003.2.1.</p>
<p>EXCEPTIONS:&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Where an existing gangway or series of gangways is replaced or altered, an increase in the length of the gangway shall not be required to comply with 1003.2 unless required by 202.4.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Gangways shall not be required to comply with the maximum rise specified in 405.6.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Where the total length of a gangway or series of gangways serving as part of a required accessible route is 80 feet (24 m) minimum, gangways shall not be required to comply with 405.2.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Where facilities contain fewer than 25 boat slips and the total length of the gangway or series of gangways serving as part of a required accessible route is 30 feet (9145 mm) minimum, gangways shall not be required to comply with 405.2.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Where gangways connect to transition plates, landings specified by 405.7 shall not be required.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Where gangways and transition plates connect and are required to have handrails, handrail extensions shall not be required. Where handrail extensions are provided on gangways or transition plates, the handrail extensions shall not be required to be parallel with the ground or floor surface.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; The cross slope specified in 403.3 and 405.3 for gangways, transition plates, and floating piers that are part of accessible routes shall be measured in the static position.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Changes in level complying with 303.3 and 303.4 shall be permitted on the surfaces of gangways and boat launch ramps.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory 1003.2.1 Boat Slips Exception 3.&nbsp; The following example shows how exception 3 would be applied:&nbsp; A gangway is provided to a floating pier which is required to be on an accessible route.&nbsp; The vertical distance is 10 feet (3050 mm) between the elevation where the gangway departs the landside connection and the elevation of the pier surface at the lowest water level.&nbsp; Exception 3 permits the gangway to be 80 feet (24 m) long. Another design solution would be to have two 40 foot (12 m) plus continuous gangways joined together at a float, where the float (as the water level falls) will stop dropping at an elevation five feet below the landside connection.&nbsp; The length of transition plates would not be included in determining if the gangway(s) meet the requirements of the exception.</p>
<p id="a100322">1003.2.2 Boarding Piers at Boat Launch Ramps.&nbsp; Accessible routes serving boarding piers at boat launch ramps shall be permitted to use the exceptions in 1003.2.2.</p>
<p>EXCEPTIONS:&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Accessible routes serving floating boarding piers shall be permitted to use Exceptions 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8 in 1003.2.1.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Where the total length of the gangway or series of gangways serving as part of a required accessible route is 30 feet (9145 mm) minimum, gangways shall not be required to comply with 405.2.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Where the accessible route serving a floating boarding pier or skid pier is located within a boat launch ramp, the portion of the accessible route located within the boat launch ramp shall not be required to comply with 405.</p>
<p id="a10033">1003.3 Clearances.&nbsp; Clearances at boat slips and on boarding piers at boat launch ramps shall comply with 1003.3.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory 1003.3 Clearances.&nbsp; Although the minimum width of the clear pier space is 60 inches (1525 mm), it is recommended that piers be wider than 60 inches (1525 mm) to improve the safety for persons with disabilities, particularly on floating piers.</p>
<p id="a100331">1003.3.1 Boat Slip Clearance.&nbsp; Boat slips shall provide clear pier space 60 inches (1525 mm) wide minimum and at least as long as the boat slips.&nbsp; Each 10 feet (3050 mm) maximum of linear pier edge serving boat slips shall contain at least one continuous clear opening 60 inches (1525 mm) wide minimum.</p>
<p>EXCEPTIONS:&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Clear pier space shall be permitted to be 36 inches (915 mm) wide minimum for a length of 24 inches (610 mm) maximum, provided that multiple 36 inch (915 mm) wide segments are separated by segments that are 60 inches (1525 mm) wide minimum and 60 inches (1525 mm) long minimum.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Edge protection shall be permitted at the continuous clear openings, provided that it is 4 inches (100 mm) high maximum and 2 inches (51 mm) wide maximum.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; In existing piers, clear pier space shall be permitted to be located perpendicular to the boat slip and shall extend the width of the boat slip, where the facility has at least one boat slip complying with 1003.3, and further compliance with 1003.3 would result in a reduction in the number of boat slips available or result in a reduction of the widths of existing slips.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory 1003.3.1 Boat Slip Clearance Exception 3. Where the conditions in exception 3 are satisfied, existing facilities are only required to have one accessible boat slip with a pier clearance which runs the length of the slip. All other accessible slips are allowed to have the required pier clearance at the head of the slip. Under this exception, at piers with perpendicular boat slips, the width of most “finger piers” will remain unchanged. However, where mooring systems for floating piers are replaced as part of pier alteration projects, an opportunity may exist for increasing accessibility.&nbsp; Piers may be reconfigured to allow an increase in the number of wider finger piers, and serve as accessible boat slips.</p>

<p id="a100332">1003.3.2 Boarding Pier Clearances.&nbsp; Boarding piers at boat launch ramps shall provide clear pier space 60 inches (1525 mm) wide minimum and shall extend the full length of the boarding pier.&nbsp; Every 10 feet (3050 mm) maximum of linear pier edge shall contain at least one continuous clear opening 60 inches (1525 mm) wide minimum.</p>
<p>EXCEPTIONS:&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; The clear pier space shall be permitted to be 36 inches (915 mm) wide minimum for a length of 24 inches (610 mm) maximum provided that multiple 36 inch (915 mm) wide segments are separated by segments that are 60 inches (1525 mm) wide minimum and 60 inches (1525 mm) long minimum.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Edge protection shall be permitted at the continuous clear openings provided that it is 4 inches (100 mm) high maximum and 2 inches (51 mm) wide maximum.</p>
<div class="advisory">
<p class="first">Advisory 1003.3.2 Boarding Pier Clearances.&nbsp; These requirements do not establish a minimum length for accessible boarding piers at boat launch ramps.&nbsp; The accessible boarding pier should have a length at least equal to that of other boarding piers provided at the facility.&nbsp; If no other boarding pier is provided, the pier would have a length equal to what would have been provided if no access requirements applied.&nbsp; The entire length of accessible boarding piers would be required to comply with the same technical provisions that apply toaccessible&nbsp;boat slips.&nbsp; For example, at a launch ramp, if a 20 foot (6100 mm) long accessible boarding pier is provided, the entire 20 feet (6100 mm) must comply with the pier clearance requirements in 1003.3.&nbsp; Likewise, if a 60 foot (18 m) long accessible boarding pier is provided, the pier clearance requirements in 1003.3 would apply to the entire 60 feet (18 m).</p>
<p class="last">The following example applies to a boat launch ramp boarding pier:&nbsp; A chain of floats is provided on a launch ramp to be used as a boarding pier which is required to be accessible by 1003.3.2.&nbsp; At high water, the entire chain is floating and a transition plate connects the first float to the surface of the launch ramp.&nbsp; As the water level decreases, segments of the chain end up resting on the launch ramp surface, matching the slope of the launch ramp.</p>

<p id="a10041">1004.1 Clear Floor Space.&nbsp; Exercise machines and equipment shall have a clear floor space complying with 305 positioned for transfer or for use by an individual seated in a wheelchair. Clear floor or ground spaces required at exercise machines and equipment shall be permitted to overlap.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory 1004.1 Clear Floor Space.&nbsp; One clear floor or ground space is permitted to be shared between two pieces of exercise equipment.&nbsp; To optimize space use, designers should carefully consider layout options such as connecting ends of the row and center aisle spaces.&nbsp; The position of the clear floor space may vary greatly depending on the use of the equipment or machine.&nbsp; For example, to provide access to a shoulder press machine, clear floor space next to the seat would be appropriate to allow for transfer.&nbsp; Clear floor space for a bench press machine designed for use by an individual seated in a wheelchair, however, will most likely be centered on the operating mechanisms.</p>
