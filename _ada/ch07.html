<p class="last">Advisory 704.4.1 Height Exception. While seats are not required at TTYs, reading and typing at a TTY is more suited to sitting than standing.

<p id="a7061">706.1 General.&nbsp; Assistive listening systems required in assembly areas shall comply with 706.</p>

<p class="first" style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin-top: 0px;">Advisory 706.1 General.&nbsp; Assistive listening systems are generally categorized by their mode of transmission.&nbsp; There are hard-wired systems and three types of wireless systems: induction loop, infrared, and FM radio transmission.&nbsp; Each has different advantages and disadvantages that can help determine which system is best for a given application.&nbsp; For example, an FM system may be better than an infrared system in some open-air assemblies since infrared signals are less effective in sunlight.&nbsp; On the other hand, an infrared system is typically a better choice than an FM system where confidential transmission is important because it will be contained within a given space.</p>
<p>The technical standards for assistive listening systems describe minimum performance levels for volume, interference, and distortion.&nbsp; Sound pressure levels (SPL), expressed in decibels, measure output sound volume.&nbsp; Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR or S/N), also expressed in decibels, represents the relationship between the loudness of a desired sound (the signal) and the background noise in a space or piece of equipment.&nbsp; The higher the SNR, the more intelligible the signal.&nbsp; The peak clipping level limits the distortion in signal output produced when high-volume sound waves are manipulated to serve assistive listening devices.</p>
<p class="last">Selecting or specifying an effective assistive listening system for a large or complex venue requires assistance from a professional sound engineer.&nbsp; The Access Board has published technical assistance on assistive listening devices and systems.</p>
</div>
<p id="a7062">706.2 Receiver Jacks.&nbsp; Receivers required for use with an assistive listening system shall include a 1/8 inch (3.2 mm) standard mono jack.</p>

<p class="advisory">Advisory 706.3 Receiver Hearing-Aid Compatibility.&nbsp; Neckloops and headsets that can be worn as neckloops are compatible with hearing aids. Receivers that are not compatible include earbuds, which may require removal of hearing aids, earphones, and headsets that must be worn over the ear, which can create disruptive interference in the transmission and can be uncomfortable for people wearing hearing aids.</p>
<p id="a7064">706.4 Sound Pressure Level.&nbsp; Assistive listening systems shall be capable of providing a sound pressure level of 110 dB minimum and 118 dB maximum with a dynamic range on the volume control of 50 dB.</p>

<p class="advisory">Advisory 707 Automatic Teller Machines and Fare Machines.&nbsp; Interactive transaction machines (ITMs), other than ATMs, are not covered by Section 707. However, for entities covered by the ADA, the Department of Justice regulations that implement the ADA provide additional guidance regarding the relationship between these requirements and elements that are not directly addressed by these requirements.&nbsp; Federal procurement law requires that ITMs purchased by the Federal government comply with standards issued by the Access Board under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.&nbsp; This law covers a variety of products, including computer hardware and software, websites, phone systems, fax machines, copiers, and similar technologies.&nbsp; For more information on Section 508 consult the Access Board's website at&nbsp;www.access-board.gov.</p>
<p id="a7071">707.1 General.&nbsp; Automatic teller machines and fare machines shall comply with 707.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory 707.1 General.&nbsp; If farecards have one tactually distinctive corner they can be inserted with greater accuracy. Token collection devices that are designed to accommodate tokens which are perforated can allow a person to distinguish more readily between tokens and common coins.&nbsp; Place accessible&nbsp;gates and fare vending machines in close proximity to other accessible&nbsp;elements when feasible so the facility is easier to use.</p>
<p id="a7072">707.2 Clear Floor or Ground Space.&nbsp; A clear floor or ground space complying with 305 shall be provided.</p>

<p class="advisory">Advisory 707.4 Privacy.&nbsp; In addition to people who are blind or visually impaired, people with limited reach who use wheelchairs or have short stature, who cannot effectively block the ATM screen with their bodies, may prefer to use speech output.&nbsp; Speech output users can benefit from an option to render the visible screen blank, thereby affording them greater personal security and privacy.</p>
<p id="a7075">707.5 Speech Output.&nbsp; Machines shall be speech enabled.&nbsp; Operating instructions and orientation, visible transaction prompts, user input verification, error messages, and all displayed information for full use shall be accessible&nbsp;to and independently usable by individuals with vision impairments. Speech shall be delivered through a mechanism that is readily available to all users, including but not limited to, an industry standard connector or a telephone handset.&nbsp; Speech shall be recorded or digitized human, or synthesized.</p>
<p>EXCEPTIONS:&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Audible tones shall be permitted instead of speech for visible output that is not displayed for security purposes, including but not limited to, asterisks representing personal identification numbers.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Advertisements and other similar information shall not be required to be audible unless they convey information that can be used in the transaction being conducted.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Where speech synthesis cannot be supported, dynamic alphabetic output shall not be required to be audible.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory 707.5 Speech Output.&nbsp; If an ATM provides additional functions such as dispensing coupons, selling theater tickets, or providing copies of monthly statements, all such functions must be available to customers using speech output.&nbsp; To avoid confusion at the ATM, the method of initiating the speech mode should be easily discoverable and should not require specialized training.&nbsp; For example, if a telephone handset is provided, lifting the handset can initiate the speech mode.</p>
<p id="a70751">707.5.1 User Control.&nbsp; Speech shall be capable of being repeated or interrupted.&nbsp; Volume control shall be provided for the speech function.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; Information on printed receipts that duplicates information available on-screen shall not be required to be presented in the form of an audible receipt.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Printed copies of bank statements and checks shall not be required to be audible.</p>

<p id="a70762">707.6.2 Numeric Keys.&nbsp; Numeric keys shall be arranged in a 12-key ascending or descending telephone keypad layout. The number five key shall be tactilely distinct from the other keys.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory 707.6.2 Numeric Keys.&nbsp; Telephone keypads and computer keyboards differ in one significant feature, ascending versus descending numerical order.&nbsp; Both types of keypads are acceptable, provided the computer-style keypad is organized similarly to the number pad located at the right on most computer keyboards, and does not resemble the line of numbers located above the computer keys.</p>
