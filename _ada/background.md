The current ADA standards are based on the updated ADA Accessibility
Guidelines (2004), which the Board issued jointly with the ABA
Accessibility Guidelines for federally funded facilities.  The updated
ADA and ABA guidelines, which were proposed for public comment in 1999,
are based on recommendations from the Board\'s ADAAG Review Advisory
Committee.  This committee reviewed ADAAG in its entirety and
recommended updates to the Board.  It consisted of 22 members
representing the design and construction industry, the building code
community, state and local government entities, and people with
disabilities.

In 2014, the Board issued
a [supplement](/guidelines-and-standards/buildings-and-sites/about-the-ada-standards/background/emergency-transportable-housing) to
the ADA and ABA guidelines that provides requirements for temporary
housing provided in disasters and emergencies.  These provisions are not
yet part of the ADA Standards.

The original ADAAG was published in 1991 and was later supplemented to
address state and local government facilities (1998), children\'s
environments (1998), play areas (2000), and recreation facilities
(2002).  These later supplements are incorporated into both the updated
ADA-ABA guidelines and the current standards.
