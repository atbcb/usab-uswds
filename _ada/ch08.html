<p class="advisory">Advisory 809.2.2 Turning Space.&nbsp; It is generally acceptable to use required clearances to provide wheelchair turning space.&nbsp; For example, in kitchens, 804.3.1 requires at least one work surface with clear floor space complying with 306 to be centered beneath.&nbsp; If designers elect to provide clear floor space that is at least 36 inches (915 mm) wide, as opposed to the required 30 inches (760 mm) wide, that clearance can be part of a T-turn, thereby maximizing efficient use of the kitchen area.&nbsp; However, the overlap of turning space must be limited to one segment of the T-turn so that back-up maneuvering is not restricted.&nbsp; It would, therefore, be unacceptable to use both the clearances under the work surface and the sink as part of a T-turn.&nbsp; See Section 304.3.2 regarding T-turns.</p>
