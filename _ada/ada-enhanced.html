            <h2 id="ada-101">101 Purpose</h2>
            <h3 id="ada-101_1">101.1 General</h3>
            <p class="standards">This document contains scoping and technical requirements for accessibility to sites, facilities, buildings, and elements by individuals with disabilities.  The requirements are to be applied during the design, construction, additions to, and alteration of sites, facilities, buildings, and elements to the extent required by regulations issued by Federal agencies under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).</p>
            <p class="advisory">Advisory 101.1 General.  In addition to these requirements, covered entities must comply with the regulations issued by the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation under the Americans with Disabilities Act.  There are issues affecting individuals with disabilities which are not addressed by these requirements, but which are covered by the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation regulations.</p>

            <h3 id="ada-101_2">101.2 Effect on Removal of Barriers in Existing Facilities</h3>
            <p class="standards">This document does not address existing facilities unless altered at the discretion of a covered entity.  The Department of Justice has authority over existing facilities that are subject to the requirement for removal of barriers under title III of the ADA.  Any determination that this document applies to existing facilities subject to the barrier removal requirement is solely within the discretion of the Department of Justice and is effective only to the extent required by regulations issued by the Department of Justice.</p>

            <h2 id="ada-102">102 Dimensions for Adults and Children</h2>
            <p class="standards">The technical requirements are based on adult dimensions and anthropometrics.  In addition, this document includes technical requirements based on children’s dimensions and anthropometrics for drinking fountains, water closets, toilet compartments, lavatories and sinks, dining surfaces, and work surfaces.</p>
            <h2 id="ada-103">103 Equivalent Facilitation</h2>
            <p class="standards">Nothing in these requirements prevents the use of designs, products, or technologies as alternatives to those prescribed, provided they result in substantially equivalent or greater accessibility and usability.</p>
            <p class="advisory">Advisory 103 Equivalent Facilitation.  The responsibility for demonstrating equivalent facilitation in the event of a challenge rests with the covered entity.  With the exception of transit facilities, which are covered by regulations issued by the Department of Transportation, there is no process for certifying that an alternative design provides equivalent facilitation.</p>
            <h2 id="ada-104">104 Conventions</h2>
            <h3 id="ada-104_1">104.1 Dimensions</h3>
            <p class="standards">Dimensions that are not stated as “maximum” or “minimum” are absolute.</p>

            <h4 id="ada-104_1_1">104.1.1 Construction and Manufacturing Tolerances</h4>
            <p class="standards"> All dimensions are subject to conventional industry tolerances except where the requirement is stated as a range with specific minimum and maximum end points.</p>
            <div id="ada-104_1_1_advisory" class="advisory">
            <p class="first">Advisory 104.1.1 Construction and Manufacturing Tolerances.  Conventional industry tolerances recognized by this provision include those for field conditions and those that may be a necessary consequence of a particular manufacturing process. Recognized tolerances are not intended to apply to design work.</p>
            <p>It is good practice when specifying dimensions to avoid specifying a tolerance where dimensions are absolute.  For example, if this document requires “1 inches,” avoid specifying “1 inches plus or minus X inches.”</p>
            <p>Where the requirement states a specified range, such as in Section <a href="#ada-609_4" class="navSectionLink">609.4</a> where grab bars must be installed between 33 inches and 36 inches above the floor, the range provides an adequate tolerance and therefore no tolerance outside of the range at either end point is permitted.</p>
            <p>Where a requirement is a minimum or a maximum dimension that does not have two specific minimum and maximum end points, tolerances may apply.  Where an element is to be installed at the minimum or maximum permitted dimension, such as “15 inches minimum” or “5 pounds maximum”, it would not be good practice to specify “5 pounds (plus X pounds) or 15 inches (minus X inches).”  Rather, it would be good practice to specify a dimension less than the required maximum (or more than the required minimum) by the amount of the expected field or manufacturing tolerance and not to state any tolerance in conjunction with the specified dimension.</p>
            <p class="last">Specifying dimensions in design in the manner described above will better ensure that facilities and elements accomplish the level of accessibility intended by these requirements.  It will also more often produce an end result of strict and literal compliance with the stated requirements and eliminate enforcement difficulties and issues that might otherwise arise.  Information on specific tolerances may be available from industry or trade organizations, code groups and building officials, and published references.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 id="ada-104_2">104.2 Calculation of Percentages</h3>
            <p class="standards">Where the required number of elements or facilities to be provided is determined by calculations of ratios or percentages and remainders or fractions result, the next greater whole number of such elements or facilities shall be provided.  Where the determination of the required size or dimension of an element or facility involves ratios or percentages, rounding down for values less than one half shall be permitted.</p>

            <h3 id="ada-104_3">104.3 Figures</h3>
            <p class="standards">Unless specifically stated otherwise, figures are provided for informational purposes only.</p>

            <div class="advisory">
            <p class="first">Advisory 105.2.2 ASME.  ASME A17.1-2000 is used by local jurisdictions throughout the United States for the design, construction, installation, operation, inspection, testing, maintenance, alteration, and repair of elevators and escalators.  The majority of the requirements apply to the operational machinery not seen or used by elevator passengers.  ASME A17.1 requires a two-way means of emergency communications in passenger elevators.  This means of communication must connect with emergency or authorized personnel and not an automated answering system.  The communication system must be push button activated.  The activation button must be permanently identified with the word “HELP.”  A visual indication acknowledging the establishment of a communications link to authorized personnel must be provided.  The visual indication must remain on until the call is terminated by authorized personnel.  The building location, the elevator car number, and the need for assistance must be provided to authorized personnel answering the emergency call.  The use of a handset by the communications system is prohibited.  Only the authorized personnel answering the call can terminate the call.  Operating instructions for the communications system must be provided in the elevator car.</p>
            <p>The provisions for escalators require that at least two flat steps be provided at the entrance and exit of every escalator and that steps on escalators be demarcated by yellow lines 2 inches wide maximum along the back and sides of steps.</p>
            <p>ASME A18.1-1999 and ASME A18.1-2003 address the design, construction, installation, operation, inspection, testing, maintenance and repair of lifts that are intended for transportation of persons with disabilities.  Lifts are classified as: vertical platform lifts, inclined platform lifts, inclined stairway chairlifts, private residence vertical platform lifts, private residence inclined platform lifts, and private residence inclined stairway chairlifts.</p>
            <p>This document does not permit the use of inclined stairway chairlifts which do not provide platforms because such lifts require the user to transfer to a seat.</p>
            <p>ASME A18.1 contains requirements for runways, which are the spaces in which platforms or seats move.  The standard includes additional provisions for runway enclosures, electrical equipment and wiring, structural support, headroom clearance (which is 80 inches minimum), lower level access ramps and pits.  The enclosure walls not used for entry or exit are required to have a grab bar the full length of the wall on platform lifts.  Access ramps are required to meet requirements similar to those for ramps in Chapter 4 of this document.</p>
            <p class="last">Each of the lift types addressed in ASME A18.1 must meet requirements for capacity, load, speed, travel, operating devices, and control equipment.  The maximum permitted height for operable parts is consistent with Section <a href="#ada-308" class="navSectionLink">308</a> of this document.  The standard also addresses attendant operation.  However, Section <a href="#ada-410_1" class="navSectionLink">410.1</a> of this document does not permit attendant operation.</p>

            <p class="standards">ASTM F 1951-99 Standard Specification for Determination of Accessibility of Surface Systems Under and Around Playground Equipment (see 1008.2.6.1).</p>
            <div class="advisory">
            <p class="first">Advisory 105.2.3 ASTM.  ASTM F 1292-99 and ASTM F 1292-04 establish a uniform means to measure and compare characteristics of surfacing materials to determine whether materials provide a safe surface under and around playground equipment.  These standards are referenced in the play areas requirements of this document when an accessible surface is required inside a play area use zone where a fall attenuating surface is also required.  The standards cover the minimum impact attenuation requirements, when tested in accordance with Test Method F 355, for surface systems to be used under and around any piece of playground equipment from which a person may fall.</p>
            <p class="standards">ASTM F 1487-01 establishes a nationally recognized safety standard for public playground equipment to address injuries identified by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.  It defines the use zone, which is the ground area beneath and immediately adjacent to a play structure or play equipment designed for unrestricted circulation around the equipment and on whose surface it is predicted that a user would land when falling from or exiting a play structure or equipment.  The play areas requirements in this document reference the ASTM F 1487 standard when defining accessible routes that overlap use zones requiring fall attenuating surfaces.  If the use zone of a playground is not entirely surfaced with an accessible material, at least one accessible route within the use zone must be provided from the perimeter to all accessible play structures or components within the playground.</p>
            <p class="last">ASTM F 1951-99 establishes a uniform means to measure the characteristics of surface systems in order to provide performance specifications to select materials for use as an accessible surface under and around playground equipment.  Surface materials that comply with this standard and are located in the use zone must also comply with ASTM F 1292.  The test methods in this standard address access for children and adults who may traverse the surfacing to aid children who are playing.  When a surface is tested it must have an average work per foot value for straight propulsion and for turning less than the average work per foot values for straight propulsion and for turning, respectively, on a hard, smooth surface with a grade of 7% (1:14).</p>

International Building Code (IBC)-2000 (including 2001 Supplement to the International Codes) and IBC-2003 are referenced for means of egress, areas of refuge, and railings provided on fishing piers and platforms.  At least one accessible means of egress is required for every accessible space and at least two accessible means of egress are required where more than one means of egress is required.  The technical criteria for accessible means of egress allow the use of exit stairways and evacuation elevators when provided in conjunction with horizontal exits or areas of refuge.  While typical elevators are not designed to be used during an emergency evacuation, evacuation elevators are designed with standby power and other features according to the elevator safety standard and can be used for the evacuation of individuals with disabilities.  The IBC also provides requirements for areas of refuge, which are fire-rated spaces on levels above or below the exit discharge levels where people unable to use stairs can go to register a call for assistance and wait for evacuation.</p>
            <p class="last">The recreation facilities requirements of this document references two sections in the IBC for fishing piers and platforms.

                <div class="advisory">
                <p class="first">Advisory 202.5 Alterations to Qualified Historic Buildings and Facilities Exception.  State Historic Preservation Officers are State appointed officials who carry out certain responsibilities under the National Historic Preservation Act.  State Historic Preservation Officers consult with Federal and State agencies, local governments, and private entities on providing access and protecting significant elements of qualified historic buildings and facilities. There are exceptions for alterations to qualified historic buildings and facilities for accessible routes (206.2.1 Exception 1 and <a href="#ada-206_2_3" class="navSectionLink">206.2.3</a> Exception 7); entrances (206.4 Exception 2); and toilet facilities (213.2 Exception 2).  When an entity believes that compliance with the requirements for any of these elements would threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or facility, the entity should consult with the State Historic Preservation Officer.  If the State Historic Preservation Officer agrees that compliance with the requirements for a specific element would threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or facility, use of the exception is permitted.  Public entities have an additional obligation to achieve program accessibility under the Department of Justice ADA regulations.  See 28 CFR 35.150.  These regulations require public entities that operate historic preservation programs to give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with disabilities.  If alterations to a qualified historic building or facility to achieve program accessibility would threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or facility, fundamentally alter the program, or result in undue financial or administrative burdens, the Department of Justice ADA regulations allow alternative methods to be used to achieve program accessibility.  In the case of historic preservation programs, such as an historic house museum, alternative methods include using audio-visual materials to depict portions of the house that cannot otherwise be made accessible.  In the case of other qualified historic properties, such as an historic government office building, alternative methods include relocating programs and services to accessible locations.  The Department of Justice ADA regulations also allow public entities to use alternative methods when altering qualified historic buildings or facilities in the rare situations where the State Historic Preservation Officer determines that it is not feasible to provide physical access using the exceptions permitted in Section <a href="#ada-202_5" class="navSectionLink">202.5</a> without threatening or destroying the historic significance of the building or facility.  See 28 CFR 35.151(d).</p>

                <p class="advisory">Advisory 223.1 General.  Because medical facilities frequently reconfigure spaces to reflect changes in medical specialties, Section <a href="#ada-223_1" class="navSectionLink">223.1</a> does not include a provision for dispersion of accessible patient or resident sleeping rooms.  The lack of a design requirement does not mean that covered entities are not required to provide services to people with disabilities where accessible rooms are not dispersed in specialty areas.  Locate accessible rooms near core areas that are less likely to change over time.  While dispersion is not required, the flexibility it provides can be a critical factor in ensuring cost effective compliance with applicable civil rights laws, including titles II and III of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.  Additionally, all types of features and amenities should be dispersed among accessible sleeping rooms to ensure equal access to and a variety of choices for all patients and residents.</p>

In alterations and additions, the minimum required number is based on the total number of sleeping rooms altered or added instead of on the total number of sleeping rooms provided in a facility.

                <p class="advisory">Advisory 235.2 Boat Slips.  The requirement for boat slips also applies to piers where boat slips are not demarcated.  For example, a single pier 25 feet (7620 mm) long and 5 feet (1525 mm) wide (the minimum width specified by Section 1003.3) allows boats to moor on three sides.  Because the number of boat slips is not demarcated, the total length of boat slip edge (55 feet, 17 m) must be used to determine the number of boat slips provided (two).  This number is based on the specification in Section <a href="#ada-235_2" class="navSectionLink">235.2</a> that each 40 feet (12 m) of boat slip edge, or fraction thereof, counts as one boat slip.  In this example, Table 235.2 would require one boat slip to be accessible.</p>

Types of boat slips are based on the size of the boat slips; whether single berths or double berths, shallow water or deep water, transient or longer-term lease, covered or uncovered; and whether slips are equipped with features such as telephone, water, electricity or cable connections.  The term “boat slip” is intended to cover any pier area other than launch ramp boarding piers where recreational boats are moored for purposes of berthing, embarking, or disembarking.  For example, a fuel pier may contain boat slips, and this type of short term slip would be included in determining compliance with 235.2.</p>

When distinguishing between the different types of ground level play components, consider the general experience provided by the play component.  Examples of different types of experiences include, but are not limited to, rocking, swinging, climbing, spinning, and sliding.  A spiral slide may provide a slightly different experience from a straight slide, but sliding is the general experience and therefore a spiral slide is not considered a different type of play component from a straight slide.</p>
                <p class="standards">Ground level play components accessed by children with disabilities must be integrated into the play area.

Accessibility to the sand box would be enhanced by providing a transfer system into the sand or by providing a raised sand table with knee clearance complying with 1008.4.3.</p>
                <p class="standards">Ramps are preferred over transfer systems since not all children who use wheelchairs or other mobility devices may be able to use, or may choose not to use, transfer systems.  Where ramps connect elevated play components, the maximum rise of any ramp run is limited to 12 inches (305 mm).  Where possible, designers and operators are encouraged to provide ramps with a slope less than the 1:12 maximum.  Berms or sculpted dirt may be used to provide elevation and may be part of an accessible route to composite play structures.</p>
                <p class="last">Platform lifts are permitted as a part of an accessible route.  Because lifts must be independently operable, operators should carefully consider the appropriateness of their use in unsupervised settings.</p>

<h3 id="ada-706_1">706.1 General</h3>
<p class="standards">Assistive listening systems required in assembly areas shall comply with <a href="#ada-706" class="navSectionLink">706</a>.</p>
<div class="advisory">
<p class="first">Advisory 706.1 General.  Assistive listening systems are generally categorized by their mode of transmission.  There are hard-wired systems and three types of wireless systems: induction loop, infrared, and FM radio transmission.  Each has different advantages and disadvantages that can help determine which system is best for a given application.  For example, an FM system may be better than an infrared system in some open-air assemblies since infrared signals are less effective in sunlight.  On the other hand, an infrared system is typically a better choice than an FM system where confidential transmission is important because it will be contained within a given space.</p>
<p class="standards">The technical standards for assistive listening systems describe minimum performance levels for volume, interference, and distortion.  Sound pressure levels (SPL), expressed in decibels, measure output sound volume.  Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR or S/N), also expressed in decibels, represents the relationship between the loudness of a desired sound (the signal) and the background noise in a space or piece of equipment.  The higher the SNR, the more intelligible the signal.  The peak clipping level limits the distortion in signal output produced when high-volume sound waves are manipulated to serve assistive listening devices.</p>
<p class="last">Selecting or specifying an effective assistive listening system for a large or complex venue requires assistance from a professional sound engineer.  The Access Board has published technical assistance on assistive listening devices and systems.</p>

The accessible boarding pier should have a length at least equal to that of other boarding piers provided at the facility.  If no other boarding pier is provided, the pier would have a length equal to what would have been provided if no access requirements applied.  The entire length of accessible boarding piers would be required to comply with the same technical provisions that apply to accessible boat slips.  For example, at a launch ramp, if a 20 foot (6100 mm) long accessible boarding pier is provided, the entire 20 feet (6100 mm) must comply with the pier clearance requirements in 1003.3.  Likewise, if a 60 foot (18 m) long accessible boarding pier is provided, the pier clearance requirements in 1003.3 would apply to the entire 60 feet (18 m).</p>

At high water, the entire chain is floating and a transition plate connects the first float to the surface of the launch ramp.  As the water level decreases, segments of the chain end up resting on the launch ramp surface, matching the slope of the launch ramp.</p>
