				<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Table 802.8.9 is based on providing a spectator in a wheelchair a line of sight over the head of a spectator two rows in front of the wheelchair space location using average anthropometrical data. The table is based on the following calculation: [(2X+34)(Y–2.25)/X]+(20.2–Y) where Y is the riser height of the rows in front of the wheelchair space location and X is the tread depth of the rows in front of the wheelchair space location. The calculation is based on the front of the wheelchair space location being located 12 inches (305 mm) from the back of the seating tread directly in front and the eye of the standing spectator being set back 8 inches (205 mm) from the riser.</p>
