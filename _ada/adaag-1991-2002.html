<li id="4.1.6(1)" style="font-weight: normal;">General. Alterations to existing buildings and facilities shall comply with the following:</li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li id="4.1.6(1)(a)">No alteration shall be undertaken which decreases or has the effect of decreasing accessibility or usability of a building or facility below the requirements for new construction at the time of alteration.</li>
    <li id="4.1.6(1)(b)">If existing elements, spaces, or common areas are altered, then each such altered element, space, feature, or area shall comply with the applicable provisions of <a href="#4.1.1">4.1.1</a> to <a href="#4.1.3">4.1.3</a> Minimum Requirements (for New Construction). If the applicable provision for new construction requires that an element, space, or common area be on an accessible route, the altered element, space, or common area is not required to be on an accessible route except as provided in <a href="#4.1.6(2)">4.1.6(2)</a> (Alterations to an Area Containing a Primary Function.)</li>
    <li id="4.1.6(1)(c)">If alterations of single elements, when considered together, amount to an alteration of a room or space in a building or facility, the entire space shall be made accessible.</li>
    <li id="4.1.6(1)(d)">No alteration of an existing element, space, or area of a building or facility shall impose a requirement for greater accessibility than that which would be required for new construction. For example, if the elevators and stairs in a building are being altered and the elevators are, in turn, being made accessible, then no accessibility modifications are required to the stairs connecting levels connected by the elevator. If stair modifications to correct unsafe conditions are required by other codes, the modifications shall be done in compliance with these guidelines unless technically infeasible.</li>

            <li>The exemption provided in paragraph (i) does not obviate or limit in any way the obligation to comply with the other accessibility requirements established in these guidelines. For example, alterations to floors above or below the ground floor must be accessible regardless of whether the altered facility has an elevator. If a facility subject to the elevator exemption set forth in paragraph (i) nonetheless has a passenger elevator, that elevator shall meet, to the maximum extent feasible, the accessibility requirements of these guidelines.</li>

<p><a class="black" name="A4.2">A4.2 Space Allowances and Reach Ranges.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.2.1">A4.2.1 Wheelchair Passage Width.</a></p>

<p>(1) Space Requirements for Wheelchairs. Many persons who use wheelchairs need a 30 in (760 mm) clear opening width for doorways, gates, and the like, when the latter are entered head-on. If the person is unfamiliar with a building, if competing traffic is heavy, if sudden or frequent movements are needed, or if the wheelchair must be turned at an opening, then greater clear widths are needed. For most situations, the addition of an inch of leeway on either side is sufficient. Thus, a minimum clear width of 32 in (815 mm) will provide adequate clearance. However, when an opening or a restriction in a passageway is more than 24 in (610 mm) long, it is essentially a passageway and must be at least 36 in (915 mm) wide.</p>
<p>(2) Space Requirements for Use of Walking Aids. Although people who use walking aids can maneuver through clear width openings of 32 in (815 mm), they need 36 in (915 mm) wide passageways and walks for comfortable gaits. Crutch tips, often extending down at a wide angle, are a hazard in narrow passageways where they might not be seen by other pedestrians. Thus, the 36 in (915 mm) width provides a safety allowance both for the person with a disability and for others.</p>
<p>(3) Space Requirements for Passing. Able-bodied persons in winter clothing, walking straight ahead with arms swinging, need 32 in (815 mm) of width, which includes 2 in (50 mm) on either side for sway, and another 1 in (25 mm) tolerance on either side for clearing nearby objects or other pedestrians. Almost all wheelchair users and those who use walking aids can also manage within this 32 in (815 mm) width for short distances. Thus, two streams of traffic can pass in 64 in (1625 mm) in a comfortable flow. Sixty inches (1525 mm) provides a minimum width for a somewhat more restricted flow. If the clear width is less than 60 in (1525 mm), two wheelchair users will not be able to pass but will have to seek a wider place for passing. Forty-eight inches (1220 mm) is the minimum width needed for an ambulatory person to pass a nonambulatory or semi-ambulatory person. Within this 48 in (1220 mm) width, the ambulatory person will have to twist to pass a wheelchair user, a person with a service animal, or a semi-ambulatory person. There will be little leeway for swaying or missteps (see Fig. A1).</p>

<p><a class="black" name="A4.2.3">A4.2.3 Wheelchair Turning Space.</a> These guidelines specify a minimum space of 60 in (1525 mm) diameter or a 60 in by 60 in (1525 mm by 1525 mm) T-shaped space for a pivoting 180-degree turn of a wheelchair. This space is usually satisfactory for turning around, but many people will not be able to turn without repeated tries and bumping into surrounding objects. The space shown in Fig. A2 will allow most wheelchair users to complete U-turns without difficulty.</p>

<p><a class="black" name="A4.3.1">A4.3.1 General.</a></p>

<p>(1) Travel Distances. Many people with mobility impairments can move at only very slow speeds; for many, traveling 200 ft (61 m) could take about 2 minutes. This assumes a rate of about 1.5 ft/s (455 mm/s) on level ground. It also assumes that the traveler would move continuously. However, on trips over 100 ft (30 m), disabled people are apt to rest frequently, which substantially increases their trip times. Resting periods of 2 minutes for every 100 ft (30 m) can be used to estimate travel times for people with severely limited stamina. In inclement weather, slow progress and resting can greatly increase a disabled person's exposure to the elements.</p>
<p>(2) Sites. Level, indirect routes or those with running slopes lower than 1:20 can sometimes provide more convenience than direct routes with maximum allowable slopes or with ramps.</p>

<p><a class="black" name="A4.3.10">A4.3.10 Egress.</a> Because people with disabilities may visit, be employed or be a resident in any building, emergency management plans with specific provisions to ensure their safe evacuation also play an essential role in fire safety and life safety.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.3.11.3">A4.3.11.3 Stairway Width.</a> A 48 in (1220 mm) wide exit stairway is needed to allow assisted evacuation (e.g., carrying a person in a wheelchair) without encroaching on the exit path for ambulatory persons.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.3.11.4">A4.3.11.4 Two-way Communication.</a> It is essential that emergency communication not be dependent on voice communications alone because the safety of people with hearing or speech impairments could be jeopardized. The visible signal requirement could be satisfied with something as simple as a button in the area of rescue assistance that lights, indicating that help is on the way, when the message is answered at the point of entry.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.4">A4.4 Protruding Objects.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.4.1">A4.4.1 General.</a> Service animals are trained to recognize and avoid hazards. However, most people with severe impairments of vision use the long cane as an aid to mobility. The two principal cane techniques are the touch technique, where the cane arcs from side to side and touches points outside both shoulders; and the diagonal technique, where the cane is held in a stationary position diagonally across the body with the cane tip touching or just above the ground at a point outside one shoulder and the handle or grip extending to a point outside the other shoulder. The touch technique is used primarily in uncontrolled areas, while the diagonal technique is used primarily in certain limited, controlled, and familiar environments. Cane users are often trained to use both techniques.</p>
<p>Potential hazardous objects are noticed only if they fall within the detection range of canes (see Fig. A4). Visually impaired people walking toward an object can detect an overhang if its lowest surface is not higher than 27 in (685 mm). When walking alongside protruding objects, they cannot detect overhangs. Since proper cane and service animal techniques keep people away from the edge of a path or from walls, a slight overhang of no more than 4 in (100 mm) is not hazardous.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/ada-aba/archive/adaag-1991-2002/figa4.gif" alt="The forward pace (right and left sweep of a cane) length is between 36 and 60 inches (915-1525 mm)." width="151" height="473" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.5">A4.5 Ground and Floor Surfaces.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.5.1">A4.5.1 General.</a> People who have difficulty walking or maintaining balance or who use crutches, canes, or walkers, and those with restricted gaits are particularly sensitive to slipping and tripping hazards. For such people, a stable and regular surface is necessary for safe walking, particularly on stairs. Wheelchairs can be propelled most easily on surfaces that are hard, stable, and regular. Soft loose surfaces such as shag carpet, loose sand or gravel, wet clay, and irregular surfaces such as cobblestones can significantly impede wheelchair movement.</p>
<p>Slip resistance is based on the frictional force necessary to keep a shoe heel or crutch tip from slipping on a walking surface under conditions likely to be found on the surface. While the <em>dynamic</em> coefficient of friction during walking varies in a complex and non-uniform way, the <em>static</em> coefficient of friction, which can be measured in several ways, provides a close approximation of the slip resistance of a surface. Contrary to popular belief, some slippage is <em>necessary</em> to walking, especially for persons with restricted gaits; a truly "non-slip" surface could not be negotiated.</p>
<p>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends that walking surfaces have a static coefficient of friction of 0.5. A research project sponsored by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) conducted tests with persons with disabilities and concluded that a higher coefficient of friction was needed by such persons. A static coefficient of friction of 0.6 is recommended for accessible routes and 0.8 for ramps.</p>
<p>It is recognized that the coefficient of friction varies considerably due to the presence of contaminants, water, floor finishes, and other factors not under the control of the designer or builder and not subject to design and construction guidelines and that compliance would be difficult to measure on the building site. Nevertheless, many common building materials suitable for flooring are now labeled with information on the static coefficient of friction. While it may not be possible to compare one product directly with another, or to guarantee a constant measure, builders and designers are encouraged to specify materials with appropriate values. As more products include information on slip resistance, improved uniformity in measurement and specification is likely. The Access Board's advisory guidelines on Slip Resistant Surfaces provides additional information on this subject.</p>
<p>Cross slopes on walks and ground or floor surfaces can cause considerable difficulty in propelling a wheelchair in a straight line.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.5.3">A4.5.3 Carpet.</a> Much more needs to be done in developing both quantitative and qualitative criteria for carpeting (i.e., problems associated with texture and weave need to be studied). However, certain functional characteristics are well established. When both carpet and padding are used, it is desirable to have minimum movement (preferably none) between the floor and the pad and the pad and the carpet which would allow the carpet to hump or warp. In heavily trafficked areas, a thick, soft (plush) pad or cushion, particularly in combination with long carpet pile, makes it difficult for individuals in wheelchairs and those with other ambulatory disabilities to get about. Firm carpeting can be achieved through proper selection and combination of pad and carpet, sometimes with the elimination of the pad or cushion, and with proper installation. Carpeting designed with a weave that causes a zig-zag effect when wheeled across is strongly discouraged.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.6">A4.6 Parking and Passenger Loading Zones.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.6.3">A4.6.3 Parking Spaces.</a> The increasing use of vans with side- mounted lifts or ramps by persons with disabilities has necessitated some revisions in specifications for parking spaces and adjacent access aisles. The typical accessible parking space is 96 in (2440 mm) wide with an adjacent 60 in (1525 mm) access aisle. However, this aisle does not permit lifts or ramps to be deployed and still leave room for a person using a wheelchair or other mobility aid to exit the lift platform or ramp. In tests conducted with actual lift/van/wheelchair combinations, (under a Board-sponsored Accessible Parking and Loading Zones Project) researchers found that a space and aisle totaling almost 204 in (5180 mm) wide was needed to deploy a lift and exit conveniently. The "van accessible" parking space required by these guidelines provides a 96 in (2440 mm) wide space with a 96 in (2440 mm) adjacent access aisle which is just wide enough to maneuver and exit from a side mounted lift. If a 96 in (2440 mm) access aisle is placed between two spaces, two "van accessible" spaces are created. Alternatively, if the wide access aisle is provided at the end of a row (an area often unused), it may be possible to provide the wide access aisle without additional space (see Fig. A5(a)).</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/ada-aba/archive/adaag-1991-2002/figa5.gif" alt="Van Parking Space Alternatives " width="252" height="474" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>A sign is needed to alert van users to the presence of the wider aisle, but the space is not intended to be restricted only to vans.</p>
<p>"Universal" Parking Space Design. An alternative to the provision of a percentage of spaces with a wide aisle, and the associated need to include additional signage, is the use of what has been called the "universal" parking space design. Under this design, <em>all</em> accessible spaces are 132 in (3350 mm) wide with a 60 in (1525 mm) access aisle (see Fig. A5(b)). One advantage to this design is that no additional signage is needed because all spaces can accommodate a van with a side-mounted lift or ramp. Also, there is no competition between cars and vans for spaces since all spaces can accommodate either. Furthermore, the wider space permits vehicles to park to one side or the other within the 132 in (3350 mm) space to allow persons to exit and enter the vehicle on either the driver or passenger side, although, in some cases, this would require exiting or entering without a marked access aisle.</p>
<p>An essential consideration for any design is having the access aisle level with the parking space. Since a person with a disability, using a lift or ramp, must maneuver within the access aisle, the aisle cannot include a ramp or sloped area. The access aisle must be connected to an accessible route to the appropriate accessible entrance of a building or facility. The parking access aisle must either blend with the accessible route or have a curb ramp complying with 4.7. Such a curb ramp opening must be located within the access aisle boundaries, not within the parking space boundaries. Unfortunately, many facilities are designed with a ramp that is blocked when any vehicle parks in the accessible space. Also, the required dimensions of the access aisle cannot be restricted by planters, curbs or wheel stops.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.6.4">A4.6.4 Signage.</a> Signs designating parking places for disabled people can be seen from a driver's seat if the signs are mounted high enough above the ground and located at the front of a parking space.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.6.5">A4.6.5 Vertical Clearance. </a>High-top vans, which disabled people or transportation services often use, require higher clearances in parking garages than automobiles.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.8">A4.8 Ramps.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.8.1">A4.8.1 General.</a> Ramps are essential for wheelchair users if elevators or lifts are not available to connect different levels. However, some people who use walking aids have difficulty with ramps and prefer stairs.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.8.2">A4.8.2 Slope and Rise.</a> Ramp slopes between 1:16 and 1:20 are preferred. The ability to manage an incline is related to both its slope and its length. Wheelchair users with disabilities affecting their arms or with low stamina have serious difficulty using inclines. Most ambulatory people and most people who use wheelchairs can manage a slope of 1:16. Many people cannot manage a slope of 1:12 for 30 ft (9 m).</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.8.4">A4.8.4 Landings.</a> Level landings are essential toward maintaining an aggregate slope that complies with these guidelines. A ramp landing that is not level causes individuals using wheelchairs to tip backward or bottom out when the ramp is approached.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.8.5">A4.8.5 Handrails.</a> The requirements for stair and ramp handrails in this guideline are for adults. When children are principal users in a building or facility (e.g. elementary schools), a second set of handrails at an appropriate height can assist them and aid in preventing accidents. A maximum height of 28 inches measured to the top of the gripping surface from the ramp surface or stair nosing is recommended for handrails designed for children. Sufficient vertical clearance between upper and lower handrails (9 inches minimum) should be provided to help prevent entrapment.</p>

<p>Ideally, emergency two-way communication systems should provide both voice and visual display intercommunication so that persons with hearing impairments and persons with vision impairments can receive information regarding the status of a rescue. A voice intercommunication system cannot be the only means of communication because it is not accessible to people with speech and hearing impairments. While a voice intercommunication system is not required, at a minimum, the system should provide both an audio and visual indication that a rescue is on the way.</p>

<p><a class="black" name="A4.12">A4.12 Windows.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.12.1">A4.12.1 General.</a> Windows intended to be operated by occupants in accessible spaces should comply with 4.12.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.12.2">A4.12.2 Window Hardware.</a> Windows requiring pushing, pulling, or lifting to open (for example, double-hung, sliding, or casement and awning units without cranks) should require no more than 5 lbf (22.2 N) to open or close. Locks, cranks, and other window hardware should comply with 4.27.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.13">A4.13 Doors.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.13.8">A4.13.8 Thresholds at Doorways.</a> Thresholds and surface height changes in doorways are particularly inconvenient for wheelchair users who also have low stamina or restrictions in arm movement because complex maneuvering is required to get over the level change while operating the door.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.13.9">A4.13.9 Door Hardware.</a> Some disabled persons must push against a door with their chair or walker to open it. Applied kickplates on doors with closers can reduce required maintenance by withstanding abuse from wheelchairs and canes. To be effective, they should cover the door width, less approximately 2 in (51 mm), up to a height of 16 in (405 mm) from its bottom edge and be centered across the width of the door.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.13.10">A4.13.10 Door Closers.</a> Closers with delayed action features give a person more time to maneuver through doorways. They are particularly useful on frequently used interior doors such as entrances to toilet rooms.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.13.11">A4.13.11 Door Opening Force.</a> Although most people with disabilities can exert at least 5 lbf (22.2N), both pushing and pulling from a stationary position, a few people with severe disabilities cannot exert 3 lbf (13.13N). Although some people cannot manage the allowable forces in this guideline and many others have difficulty, door closers must have certain minimum closing forces to close doors satisfactorily. Forces for pushing or pulling doors open are measured with a push-pull scale under the following conditions:</p>

<p>(1) Hinged doors: Force applied perpendicular to the door at the door opener or 30 in (760 mm) from the hinged side, whichever is farther from the hinge.</p>
<p>(2) Sliding or folding doors: Force applied parallel to the door at the door pull or latch.</p>
<p>(3) Application of force: Apply force gradually so that the applied force does not exceed the resistance of the door. In high-rise buildings, air-pressure differentials may require a modification of this specification in order to meet the functional intent.</p>

<p><a class="black" name="A4.13.12">A4.13.12 Automatic Doors and Power-Assisted Doors.</a> Sliding automatic doors do not need guard rails and are more convenient for wheelchair users and visually impaired people to use. If slowly opening automatic doors can be reactivated before their closing cycle is completed, they will be more convenient in busy doorways.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.15">A4.15 Drinking Fountains and Water Coolers.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.15.2">A4.15.2 Spout Height.</a> Two drinking fountains, mounted side by side or on a single post, are usable by people with disabilities and people who find it difficult to bend over.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.16">A4.16 Water Closets.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.16.3">A4.16.3 Height.</a> Height preferences for toilet seats vary considerably among disabled people. Higher seat heights may be an advantage to some ambulatory disabled people, but are often a disadvantage for wheelchair users and others. Toilet seats 18 in (455 mm) high seem to be a reasonable compromise. Thick seats and filler rings are available to adapt standard fixtures to these requirements.</p>
<p>A4.16.4 Grab Bars.Fig. A6(a) and (b) show the diagonal and side approaches most commonly used to transfer from a wheelchair to a water closet. Some wheelchair users can transfer from the front of the toilet while others use a 90-degree approach. Most people who use the two additional approaches can also use either the diagonal approach or the side approach.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/ada-aba/archive/adaag-1991-2002/figa6.gif" alt="Fig. A6(a) Diagonal Approach (to the toilet fixture). A diagonal transfer is illustrated as follows.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.16.5">A4.16.5 Flush Controls.</a> Flush valves and related plumbing can be located behind walls or to the side of the toilet, or a toilet seat lid can be provided if plumbing fittings are directly behind the toilet seat. Such designs reduce the chance of injury and imbalance caused by leaning back against the fittings. Flush controls for tank-type toilets have a standardized mounting location on the left side of the tank (facing the tank). Tanks can be obtained by special order with controls mounted on the right side. If administrative authorities require flush controls for flush valves to be located in a position that conflicts with the location of the rear grab bar, then that bar may be split or shifted toward the wide side of the toilet area.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.16.7">A4.16.7 Water Closets for Children.</a> The requirements in 4.16.7 are to be followed where the exception for children's water closets in 4.16.1 is utilized. Use of this exception is optional since these guidelines do not require water closets or other building elements to be designed according to children's dimensions. The following table provides additional guidance in applying the specifications for water closets for children according to the age group served and reflects the differences in the size, stature, and reach ranges of children 3 through 12. The specifications chosen should correspond to the age of the primary user group. The specifications of one age group should be applied consistently in the installation of a water closet and related elements.</p>

<p><a class="black" name="A4.17">A4.17 Toilet Stalls.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.17.3">A4.17.3 Size and Arrangement.</a> This section requires use of the 60 in (1525 mm) standard stall (Figure 30(a)) and permits the 36 in (915 mm) or 48 in (1220 mm) wide alternate stall (Figure 30(b)) only in alterations where provision of the standard stall is technically infeasible or where local plumbing codes prohibit reduction in the number of fixtures. A standard stall provides a clear space on one side of the water closet to enable persons who use wheelchairs to perform a side or diagonal transfer from the wheelchair to the water closet. However, some persons with disabilities who use mobility aids such as walkers, canes or crutches are better able to use the two parallel grab bars in the 36 in (915 mm) wide alternate stall to achieve a standing position.</p>
<p>In large toilet rooms, where six or more toilet stalls are provided, it is therefore required that a 36 in (915 mm) wide stall with parallel grab bars be provided <em>in addition</em> to the standard stall required in new construction. The 36 in (915 mm) width is necessary to achieve proper use of the grab bars; wider stalls would position the grab bars too far apart to be easily used and narrower stalls would position the grab bars too close to the water closet. Since the stall is primarily intended for use by persons using canes, crutches and walkers, rather than wheelchairs, the length of the stall could be conventional. The door, however, must swing outward to ensure a usable space for people who use crutches or walkers.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.17.5">A4.17.5 Doors.</a> To make it easier for wheelchair users to close toilet stall doors, doors can be provided with closers, spring hinges, or a pull bar mounted on the inside surface of the door near the hinge side.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.17.7">A4.17.7 Toilet Stalls for Children.</a> See <a href="#A4.16.7">A4.16.7</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A4.19 Lavatories and Mirrors.</strong></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.19.6">A4.19.6 Mirrors.</a> If mirrors are to be used by both ambulatory people and wheelchair users, then they must be at least 74 in (1880 mm) high at their topmost edge. A single full length mirror can accommodate all people, including children. Clear floor space for a forward approach 30 by 48 inches (760 mm by 1220 mm) should be provided in front of full length mirrors. Doors should not swing into this clear floor space. Mirrors provided above lavatories designed for children should be mounted with the bottom edge of the reflecting surface no higher than 34 inches (865 mm) above the finish floor or at the lowest mounting height permitted by fixtures and related elements.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.21">A4.21 Shower Stalls.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.21.1">A4.21.1 General.</a> Shower stalls that are 36 in by 36 in (915 mm by 915 mm) wide provide additional safety to people who have difficulty maintaining balance because all grab bars and walls are within easy reach. Seated people use the walls of 36 in by 36 in (915 mm by 915 mm) showers for back support. Shower stalls that are 60 in (1525 mm) wide and have no curb may increase usability of a bathroom by wheelchair users because the shower area provides additional maneuvering space.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.22">A4.22 Toilet Rooms.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.22.3">A4.22.3 Clear Floor Space.</a> In many small facilities, single- user restrooms may be the only facilities provided for all building users. In addition, the guidelines allow the use of "unisex" or "family" accessible toilet rooms in alterations when technical infeasibility can be demonstrated. Experience has shown that the provision of accessible "unisex" or single-user restrooms is a reasonable way to provide access for wheelchair users and any attendants, especially when attendants are of the opposite sex. Since these facilities have proven so useful, it is often considered advantageous to install a "unisex" toilet room in new facilities in addition to making the multi-stall restrooms accessible, especially in shopping malls, large auditoriums, and convention centers.</p>
<p>Figure 28 (section 4.16) provides minimum clear floor space dimensions for toilets in accessible "unisex" toilet rooms. The dotted lines designate the minimum clear floor space, depending on the direction of approach, required for wheelchair users to transfer onto the water closet. The dimensions of 48 in (1220 mm) and 60 in (1525 mm), respectively, correspond to the space required for the two common transfer approaches utilized by wheelchair users (see Fig. A6). It is important to keep in mind that the placement of the lavatory to the immediate side of the water closet will preclude the side approach transfer illustrated in Figure A6(b). To accommodate the side transfer, the space adjacent to the water closet must remain clear of obstruction for 42 in (1065 mm) from the centerline of the toilet <a href="/figures/fig28.html">(Figure 28)</a> and the lavatory must not be located within this clear space. A turning circle or T-turn, the clear floor space at the lavatory, and maneuvering space at the door must be considered when determining the possible wall locations. A privacy latch or other accessible means of ensuring privacy during use should be provided at the door.</p>
<p>RECOMMENDATIONS:</p>

<p>1. In new construction, accessible single-user restrooms may be desirable in some situations because they can accommodate a wide variety of building users. However, they cannot be used in lieu of making the multi-stall toilet rooms accessible as required.</p>
<p>2. Where strict compliance to the guidelines for accessible toilet facilities is technically infeasible in the alteration of existing facilities, accessible "unisex" toilets are a reasonable alternative.</p>
<p>3. In designing accessible single-user restrooms, the provisions of adequate space to allow a side transfer will provide accommodation to the largest number of wheelchair users.</p>

<p><a class="black" name="A4.23">A4.23 Bathrooms, Bathing Facilities, and Shower Rooms.</a></p>
<p>A4.23.3 Clear Floor Space.Figure A7 shows two possible configurations of a toilet room with a roll-in shower. The specific shower shown is designed to fit exactly within the dimensions of a standard bathtub. Since the shower does not have a lip, the floor space can be used for required maneuvering space. This would permit a toilet room to be smaller than would be permitted with a bathtub and still provide enough floor space to be considered accessible. This design can provide accessibility in facilities where space is at a premium (i.e., hotels and medical care facilities). The alternate roll-in shower (Fig. 57b) also provides sufficient room for the "T-turn" and does not require plumbing to be on more than one wall.</p>

<p><a class="black" name="A4.26">A4.26 Handrails, Grab Bars, and Tub and Shower Seats.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.26.1">A4.26.1 General.</a> Many disabled people rely heavily upon grab bars and handrails to maintain balance and prevent serious falls. Many people brace their forearms between supports and walls to give them more leverage and stability in maintaining balance or for lifting. The grab bar clearance of 1-1/2 in (38 mm) required in this guideline is a safety clearance to prevent injuries resulting from arms slipping through the openings. It also provides adequate gripping room.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.26.2">A4.26.2 Size and Spacing of Grab Bars and Handrails.</a> This specification allows for alternate shapes of handrails as long as they allow an opposing grip similar to that provided by a circular section of 1-1/4 in to 1-1/2 in (32 mm to 38 mm).</p>

<p>Electrical receptacles installed to serve individual appliances and not intended for regular or frequent use by building occupants are not required to be mounted within the specified reach ranges. Examples would be receptacles installed specifically for wall-mounted clocks, refrigerators, and microwave ovens.

<p><a class="black" name="A4.28">A4.28 Alarms.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.28.2">A4.28.2 Audible Alarms.</a> Audible emergency signals must have an intensity and frequency that can attract the attention of individuals who have partial hearing loss. People over 60 years of age generally have difficulty perceiving frequencies higher than 10,000 Hz. An alarm signal which has a periodic element to its signal, such as single stroke bells (clang-pause-clang- pause), hi-low (up-down-up-down) and fast whoop (on-off-on-off) are best. Avoid continuous or reverberating tones. Select a signal which has a sound characterized by three or four clear tones without a great deal of "noise" in between.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.28.3">A4.28.3 Visual Alarms.</a> The specifications in this section do not preclude the use of zoned or coded alarm systems.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.28.4">A4.28.4 Auxiliary Alarms.</a> Locating visual emergency alarms in rooms where persons who are deaf may work or reside alone can ensure that they will always be warned when an emergency alarm is activated. To be effective, such devices must be located and oriented so that they will spread signals and reflections throughout a space or raise the overall light level sharply. However, visual alarms alone are not necessarily the best means to alert sleepers. A study conducted by Underwriters Laboratory (UL) concluded that a flashing light more than seven times brighter was required (110 candela v. 15 candela, at the same distance) to awaken sleepers as was needed to alert awake subjects in a normal daytime illuminated room.</p>
<p>For hotel and other rooms where people are likely to be asleep, a signal-activated vibrator placed between mattress and box spring or under a pillow was found by UL to be much more effective in alerting sleepers. Many readily available devices are sound- activated so that they could respond to an alarm clock, clock radio, wake-up telephone call or room smoke detector. Activation by a building alarm system can either be accomplished by a separate circuit activating an auditory alarm which would, in turn, trigger the vibrator or by a signal transmitted through the ordinary 110-volt outlet. Transmission of signals through the power line is relatively simple and is the basis of common, inexpensive remote light control systems sold in many department and electronic stores for home use. So-called "wireless" intercoms operate on the same principal.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.29">A4.29 Detectable Warnings.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.29.2">A4.29.2 Detectable Warnings on Walking Surfaces.</a> The material used to provide contrast should contrast by at least 70%. Contrast in percent is determined by:</p>
<h4 align="center"><strong>Contrast = [(B<sub>1</sub> - B<sub>2</sub>)/B<sub>1</sub>] x 100</strong></h4>
<p>where B<sub>1</sub> = light reflectance value (LRV) of the lighter area and B<sub>2</sub> = light reflectance value (LRV) of the darker area.</p>
<p>Note that in any application both white and black are never absolute; thus, B<sub>1</sub> never equals 100 and B<sub>2</sub> is always greater than 0.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.30">A4.30 Signage.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.30.1">A4.30.1 General.</a> In building complexes where finding locations independently on a routine basis may be a necessity (for example, college campuses), tactile maps or prerecorded instructions can be very helpful to visually impaired people. Several maps and auditory instructions have been developed and tested for specific applications. The type of map or instructions used must be based on the information to be communicated, which depends highly on the type of buildings or users.</p>
<p>Landmarks that can easily be distinguished by visually impaired individuals are useful as orientation cues. Such cues include changes in illumination level, bright colors, unique patterns, wall murals, location of special equipment or other architectural features.</p>
<p>Many people with disabilities have limitations in movement of their heads and reduced peripheral vision. Thus, signage positioned perpendicular to the path of travel is easiest for them to notice. People can generally distinguish signage within an angle of 30 degrees to either side of the centerlines of their faces without moving their heads.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.30.2">A4.30.2 Character Proportion.</a> The legibility of printed characters is a function of the viewing distance, character height, the ratio of the stroke width to the height of the character, the contrast of color between character and background, and print font. The size of characters must be based upon the intended viewing distance. A severely nearsighted person may have to be much closer to recognize a character of a given size than a person with normal visual acuity.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.30.4">A4.30.4 Raised and Brailled Characters and Pictorial Symbol Signs (Pictograms).</a> The standard dimensions for literary Braille are as follows:</p>

<p>Dot diameter: .059 in.<br>Inter-dot spacing: .090 in.<br>Horizontal separation between cells: .241 in.<br>Vertical separation between cells: .395 in.</p>

<p>Raised borders around signs containing raised characters may make them confusing to read unless the border is set far away from the characters. Accessible signage with descriptive materials about public buildings, monuments, and objects of cultural interest may not provide sufficiently detailed and meaningful information. Interpretive guides, audio tape devices, or other methods may be more effective in presenting such information.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.30.5">A4.30.5 Finish and Contrast.</a> An eggshell finish (11 to 19 degree gloss on 60 degree glossimeter) is recommended. Research indicates that signs are more legible for persons with low vision when characters contrast with their background by at least 70 percent. Contrast in percent shall be determined by:</p>
<h4 align="center">Contrast = [(B<sub>1</sub> - B<sub>2</sub>)/B<sub>1</sub>] x 100</h4>
<p>where B<sub>1</sub> = light reflectance value (LRV) of the lighter area and B<sub>2</sub> = light reflectance value (LRV) of the darker area.</p>
<p>Note that in any application both white and black are never absolute; thus, B<sub>1</sub> never equals 100 and B<sub>2</sub> is always greater than 0.</p>
<p>The greatest readability is usually achieved through the use of light-colored characters or symbols on a dark background.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.30.7">A4.30.7 Symbols of Accessibility for Different Types of Listening Systems.</a> Paragraph 4 of this section requires signage indicating the availability of an assistive listening system. An appropriate message should be displayed with the international symbol of access for hearing loss since this symbol conveys general accessibility for people with hearing loss. Some suggestions are:</p>
<div align="center">
<pre>INFRARED ASSISTIVE LISTENING SYSTEM AVAILABLE ----PLEASE ASK----   AUDIO LOOP IN USE TURN T-SWITCH FOR BETTER HEARING ----OR ASK FOR HELP----   FM ASSISTIVE LISTENING SYSTEM AVAILABLE ----PLEASE ASK----</pre>
</div>
<p>The symbol may be used to notify persons of the availability of other auxiliary aids and services such as: real time captioning, captioned note taking, sign language interpreters, and oral interpreters.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.30.8">A4.30.8 Illumination Levels.</a> Illumination levels on the sign surface shall be in the 100 to 300 lux range (10 to 30 footcandles) and shall be uniform over the sign surface. Signs shall be located such that the illumination level on the surface of the sign is not significantly exceeded by the ambient light or visible bright lighting source behind or in front of the sign.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.31">A4.31 Telephones.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.31.3">A4.31.3 Mounting Height.</a> In localities where the dial-tone first system is in operation, calls can be placed at a coin telephone through the operator without inserting coins. The operator button is located at a height of 46 in (1170 mm) if the coin slot of the telephone is at 54 in (1370 mm). A generally available public telephone with a coin slot mounted lower on the equipment would allow universal installation of telephones at a height of 48 in (1220 mm) or less to all operable parts.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.31.9(1)">A4.31.9(1)</a> A public text telephone (TTY) may be an integrated text telephone (TTY) pay telephone unit or a conventional portable text telephone (TTY) that is permanently affixed within, or adjacent to, the telephone enclosure. In order to be usable with a pay telephone, a text telephone (TTY) which is not a single integrated text telephone (TTY) pay telephone unit will require a shelf large enough (10 in (255 mm) wide by 10 in (255 mm) deep with a 6 in (150 mm) vertical clearance minimum) to accommodate the device, an electrical outlet, and a power cord.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.31.9(3)">A4.31.9(3)</a> Movable or portable text telephones (TTYs) may be used to provide equivalent facilitation. A text telephone (TTY) should be readily available so that a person using it may access the text telephone (TTY) easily and conveniently. As currently designed, pocket-type text telephones (TTYs) for personal use do not accommodate a wide range of users. Such devices would not be considered substantially equivalent to conventional text telephones (TTYs). However, in the future as technology develops this could change.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.32">A4.32 Fixed or Built-in Seating and Tables.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.32.4">A4.32.4 Height of Tables or Counters.</a> Different types of work require different table or counter heights for comfort and optimal performance. Light detailed work such as writing requires a table or counter close to elbow height for a standing person. Heavy manual work such as rolling dough requires a counter or table height about 10 in (255 mm) below elbow height for a standing person. This principle of high/low table or counter heights also applies for seated persons; however, the limiting condition for seated manual work is clearance under the table or counter.</p>
<p>Table A1 shows convenient counter heights for seated persons. The great variety of heights for comfort and optimal performance indicates a need for alternatives or a compromise in height if people who stand and people who sit will be using the same counter area.</p>

<p>(1) All dimensions are based on a work-surface thickness of 1 1/2 in (38 mm) and a clearance of 1 1/2 in (38 mm) between legs and the underside of a work surface.</p>
<p>(2) This type of wheelchair arm does not interfere with the positioning of a wheelchair under a work surface.</p>
<p>(3) This dimension is limited by the height of the armrests: a lower height would be preferable. Some people in this group prefer lower work surfaces, which require positioning the wheelchair back from the edge of the counter.</p>

<p><a class="black" name="A4.33">A4.33 Assembly Areas.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.33.2">A4.33.2 Size of Wheelchair Locations.</a> Spaces large enough for two wheelchairs allow people who are coming to a performance together to sit together.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.33.3">A4.33.3 Placement of Wheelchair Locations.</a> The location of wheelchair areas can be planned so that a variety of positions within the seating area are provided. This will allow choice in viewing and price categories.</p>
<p>Building/life safety codes set minimum distances between rows of fixed seats with consideration of the number of seats in a row, the exit aisle width and arrangement, and the location of exit doors. "Continental" seating, with a greater number of seats per row and a commensurate increase in row spacing and exit doors, facilitates emergency egress for all people and increases ease of access to mid-row seats especially for people who walk with difficulty. Consideration of this positive attribute of "continental" seating should be included along with all other factors in the design of fixed seating areas.</p>
<p>Removable armrests are recommended on fixed companion seats provided in assembly areas in amusement facilities. This provides the option for an individual using a wheelchair or other mobility device to transfer into a seat where motion and other effects may be provided as part of the amusement experience.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.33.6">A4.33.6 Placement of Listening Systems.</a> A distance of 50 ft (15 m) allows a person to distinguish performers' facial expressions.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.33.7">A4.33.7 Types of Listening Systems.</a> An assistive listening system appropriate for an assembly area for a group of persons or where the specific individuals are not known in advance, such as a playhouse, lecture hall or movie theater, may be different from the system appropriate for a particular individual provided as an auxiliary aid or as part of a reasonable accommodation. The appropriate device for an individual is the type that individual can use, whereas the appropriate system for an assembly area will necessarily be geared toward the "average" or aggregate needs of various individuals. A listening system that can be used from any seat in a seating area is the most flexible way to meet this specification. Earphone jacks with variable volume controls can benefit only people who have slight hearing loss and do not help people who use hearing aids. At the present time, magnetic induction loops are the most feasible type of listening system for people who use hearing aids equipped with "T- coils," but people without hearing aids or those with hearing aids not equipped with inductive pick-ups cannot use them without special receivers. Radio frequency systems can be extremely effective and inexpensive. People without hearing aids can use them, but people with hearing aids need a special receiver to use them as they are presently designed. If hearing aids had a jack to allow a by-pass of microphones, then radio frequency systems would be suitable for people with and without hearing aids. The Department of Justice's regulations implementing titles II and III of the ADA require public accommodations to provide appropriate auxiliary aids and services to ensure effective communication. See <a href="http://www.ada.gov/reg2.html">28 C.F.R. 35.160</a>, <a href="http://www.ada.gov/reg2.html">28 C.F.R. 35.164</a>, and <a href="http://www.ada.gov/reg3a.html">28 C.F.R. 36.303</a>. Where assistive listening systems are used to provide effective communication, the Department of Justice considers it essential that a portion of receivers be compatible with hearing aids.</p>
<p>Some listening systems may be subject to interference from other equipment and feedback from hearing aids of people who are using the systems. Such interference can be controlled by careful engineering design that anticipates feedback sources in the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Table A2, shows some of the advantages and disadvantages of different types of assistive listening systems. In addition, the Access Board has published a pamphlet on Assistive Listening Systems which lists demonstration centers across the country where technical assistance can be obtained in selecting and installing appropriate systems. The state of New York has also adopted a detailed technical specification which may be useful.</p>

<p><a class="black" name="A4.36.2">A4.36.2 Saunas and Steam Rooms.</a> A 60-inch turning diameter space or a T-shaped space is required within the sauna or steam room. Removable benches or seats are permitted to obstruct the 60-inch or T-shaped space.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A4.37.3">A4.37.3 Benches.</a> Back support may be achieved through locating benches adjacent to walls or by other designs that will meet the minimum dimensions specified.</p>

<p><strong>A5.1 General.</strong> Dining counters (where there is no service) are typically found in small carry-out restaurants, bakeries, or coffee shops and may only be a narrow eating surface attached to a wall. This section requires that where such a dining counter is provided, a portion of the counter shall be at the required accessible height.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A7.0">A7.0 Business, Mercantile and Civic.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A7.2(3)">A7.2(3)(iii) Counter or Teller Windows with Partitions.</a> Methods of facilitating voice communication may include grilles, slats, talk-through baffles, and other devices mounted directly into the partition which users can speak directly into for effective communication. These methods are required to be designed or placed so that they are accessible to a person who is standing or seated. However, if the counter is only used by persons in a seated position, then a method of facilitating communication which is accessible to standing persons would not be necessary.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A7.2(4)">A7.2(4) Assistive Listening Systems.</a> At all sales and service counters, teller windows, box offices, and information kiosks where a physical barrier separates service personnel and customers, it is recommended that at least one permanently installed assistive listening device complying with 4.33 be provided at each location or series. Where assistive listening devices are installed, signage should be provided identifying those stations which are so equipped.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A7.3">A7.3 Check-out Aisles.</a> Section 7.2 refers to counters without aisles; section 7.3 concerns check-out aisles. A counter without an aisle (7.2) can be approached from more than one direction such as in a convenience store. In order to use a check-out aisle (7.3), customers must enter a defined area (an aisle) at a particular point, pay for goods, and exit at a particular point.</p>

<p><a class="black" name="A10.3.1(7)">A10.3.1(7) Route Signs.</a> One means of making control buttons on fare vending machines usable by persons with vision impairments is to raise them above the surrounding surface. Those activated by a mechanical motion are likely to be more detectable. If farecard vending, collection, and adjustment devices are designed to accommodate farecards having one tactually distinctive corner, then a person who has a vision impairment will insert the card with greater ease. Token collection devices that are designed to accommodate tokens which are perforated can allow a person to distinguish more readily between tokens and common coins. Thoughtful placement of accessible gates and fare vending machines in relation to inaccessible devices will make their use and detection easier for all persons with disabilities.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A10.4">A10.4 Airports.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A10.4.1(8)">A10.4.1(8) Security Systems.</a> This provision requires that, at a minimum, an accessible route or path of travel be provided but does not require security equipment or screening devices to be accessible. However, where barriers consist of movable equipment, it is recommended that they comply with the provisions of this section to provide persons with disabilities the ability to travel with the same ease and convenience as other members of the general public.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A11.0">A11.0 Judicial, Legislative and Regulatory Facilities.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A11.1.3">A11.1.3 Two-Way Communication Systems.</a> Two-way communication entry systems must provide both voice and visual display so that persons with hearing or speech impairments can utilize the system. This requirement may be met with a device that would allow security personnel to respond to a caller with a light indicating that assistance is on the way. It is important that signage be provided to indicate the meaning of visual signals.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A11.2.1(2)">A11.2.1(2) Assistive Listening Systems.</a> People who wear hearing aids often need them while using assistive listening systems. The Department of Justice's regulation implementing title II of the ADA requires public entities to provide appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to ensure effective communication. See <a href="http://www.ada.gov/reg2.html">28 C.F.R. 35.160</a> and <a href="http://www.ada.gov/reg2.html">28 C.F.R. 35.164</a>. Where assistive listening systems are used to provide effective communication, the Department of Justice considers it essential that a portion of receivers be compatible with hearing aids. Receivers that are not compatible include ear buds, which require removal of hearing aids, and headsets that must be worn over the ear, which can create disruptive interference in the transmission.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A11.2.3(2)(b)">A11.2.3(2)(b) Toilet and Bathing Facilities.</a> The requirements of 4.22 for toilet rooms and 4.23 for bathrooms, bathing facilities, and shower rooms do not preclude the placement of toilet or bathing fixtures within housing or holding cells or rooms as long as the requirements for toilet rooms and bathrooms, including maneuvering space, are met. In such instances, the maneuvering space required within housing or holding cells or rooms may also serve as the maneuvering space required in toilet rooms by 4.22 or in bathrooms or shower rooms by 4.23.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A11.2.3(2)(c)">A11.2.3(2)(c) Beds.</a> The height of beds should be 17 in to 19 in (430 mm to 485 mm) measured from the finish floor to the bed surface, including mattresses or bed rolls, to ensure appropriate transfer from wheelchairs and other mobility aids. Where upper bunks are provided, sufficient clearance should be provided between bunks so that the transfer from wheelchairs to lower bunks is not restricted. Figure A3 provides average human dimensions that should be considered in determining this clearance.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A11.2.3(3)">A11.2.3(3) Visiting Areas.</a> Accessible cubicles or portions of counters may have fixed seats if the required clear floor space is provided within the area defined by the cubicle. Consideration should be given to the placement of grilles, talk-thru baffles, intercoms, telephone handsets or other communication devices so they are usable from both the fixed seat and from the accessible seating area. If an assistive listening system is provided, the needs of the intended user and characteristics of the setting should be considered as described in <a href="#A4.33.7">A4.33.7</a> and <a href="#Table A2">Table A2</a>.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A11.3">A11.3 Legislative and Regulatory Facilities.</a> Legislative facilities include town halls, city council chambers, city or county commissioners' meeting rooms, and State capitols. Regulatory facilities are those which house State and local entities whose functions include regulating, governing, or licensing activities. Section 11.3 applies to rooms where public debate, or discussion of local issues, laws, ordinances, or regulations take place. Examples include, but are not limited to, legislative chambers and hearing rooms, facilities where town, county council or school Board meetings, and housing authority meetings are held, and rooms accommodating licensing or other regulatory board hearings, adjudicatory administrative hearings (e.g., drivers license suspension hearings) and zoning application and waiver proceedings.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A11.3.2">A11.3.2</a> See <a href="#A11.2.1(2)">A11.2.1(2)</a>.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A12.0">A12.0 Detention and Correctional Facilities.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A12.1">A12.1 General.</a> All common use areas serving accessible cells or rooms are required to be accessible. In detention and correctional facilities, common use areas include those areas serving a group of inmates or detainees, including, but not limited to, exercise yards and recreation areas, workshops and areas of instruction or vocational training, counseling centers, cafeterias, commissaries, medical facilities, and any other rooms, spaces, or elements that are made available for the use of a group of inmates or detainees. Detention and correctional facilities also contain areas that may be regarded as common use areas which specifically serve a limited number of housing cells or rooms. Where this occurs, only those common use areas serving accessible cells or rooms would need to be accessible as required by 12.5. For example, several housing cells may be located at and served by a dayroom or recreation room. In this instance, only those dayrooms serving accessible housing cells or rooms would need to be accessible. However, common use areas that do not serve accessible cells but that are used by the public or by employees as work areas are still subject to the requirements for public use areas and employee work areas in section 4.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A12.2.1">A12.2.1 Entrances.</a> Persons other than inmates and facility staff, such as counselors and instructors, may have access to secured areas. It is important that evacuation planning address egress for all possible users since a person with a disability might not be able to independently operate doors permitted by this exception.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A12.3">A12.3 Visiting Areas.</a> Accessible cubicles or portions of counters may have fixed seats if the required clear floor space is provided within the area defined by the cubicle. Consideration should be given to the placement of grilles, talk-thru baffles, intercoms, telephone handsets or other communication devices so they are usable from both the fixed seat and from the accessible seating area. If an assistive listening system is provided, the needs of the intended user and characteristics of the setting should be considered as described in <a href="#A4.33.7">A4.33.7</a> and <a href="#Table A2">Table A2</a>.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A12.4.1">A12.4.1 Holding Cells and General Housing Cells or Rooms.</a> Accessible cells or rooms should be dispersed among different levels of security, housing categories and holding classifications (e.g., male/female and adult/juvenile) to facilitate access. Many detention and correctional facilities are designed so that certain areas (e.g., "shift" areas) can be adapted to serve as different types of housing according to need. For example, a shift area serving as a medium security housing unit might be redesignated for a period of time as a high security housing unit to meet capacity needs. Placement of accessible cells or rooms in shift areas may allow additional flexibility in meeting requirements for dispersion of accessible cells or rooms.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A12.4.2">A12.4.2 Special Holding and Housing Cells or Rooms.</a> While one of each type of special purpose cell is required to be accessible at a facility, constructing more than one of each type to be accessible will facilitate access at large facilities where cells of each type serve different holding areas or housing units. The requirement for medical isolation cells applies only to those specifically designed for medical isolation. Cells or rooms primarily designed for other purposes, such as general housing or medical care, are subject to the requirements in 12.4.1 or 12.4.4, respectively. Medical isolation cells required to be accessible by 12.4.2 shall not be counted as part of the minimum number of patient bedrooms or cells required to be accessible in 12.4.4. Thus, if a medical care facility has both types of cells, at least one medical isolation cell must be accessible under 12.4.2 in addition to the number of patient bedrooms or cells required to be accessible by 12.4.4. While only one medical isolation cell per facility is required to be accessible, it is recommended that consideration be given to ensuring the accessibility of all medical isolation cells.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A12.4.3">A12.4.3 Accessible Cells or Rooms for Persons with Hearing Impairments.</a> Many correctional facilities do not provide permanently installed telephones or alarms within individual housing cells. Such facilities are not subject to the requirements of 12.4.3. However, some categories of housing, such as minimum security prisons, may be equipped with such devices. The minimum two percent is based on the number of cells or rooms equipped with these devices and not on the total number of cells or rooms in the facility. In addition, this requirement applies only where permanently installed telephones or alarms are provided within individual cells. Permanently installed telephones and alarms located in common use areas, such as dayrooms, are required to be accessible according to the requirements for common use areas. See 12.1.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A12.5.2">A12.5.2 Minimum Requirements.</a> The requirements of this section apply to elements provided within housing or holding cells or rooms. Elements located outside cells or rooms for common use, such as in a day room, are subject to 12.1 and its application of requirements in section 4. For example, if a drinking fountain is provided within an accessible housing or holding cell, at least one must be wheelchair accessible under section 12.5.2(4). Drinking fountains located outside the cells in common use areas serving accessible cells or in public use areas, are subject to the requirements of 4.1.3(10).</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A12.5.2(2)">A12.5.2(2) Toilet and Bathing Facilities.</a> The requirements of 4.22 for toilet rooms and 4.23 for bathrooms, bathing facilities, and shower rooms do not preclude the placement of toilet or bathing fixtures within housing or holding cells or rooms as long as the requirements for toilet rooms and bathrooms, including maneuvering space, are met. In such instances, the maneuvering space required within housing or holding cells or rooms may also serve as the maneuvering space required in toilet rooms by 4.22 or in bathrooms or shower rooms by 4.23.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A12.5.2(3)">A12.5.2(3) Beds.</a> Since beds may not always be fixed, a minimum number of accessible beds has not been specified. In barracks-style rooms with many beds, it is recommended that the scoping requirement for housing or holding cells or rooms (2 percent) also be applied to the number of beds in accessible cells or rooms.</p>
<p>The height of beds should be 17 to 19 in (430 mm to 485 mm) measured from the finish floor to the bed surface, including mattresses or bed rolls, to ensure appropriate transfer from wheelchairs and other mobility aids. Where upper bunks are provided, sufficient clearance must be provided between bunks so that the transfer from wheelchairs to lower bunks is not restricted. Figure A3 provides standard human dimensions that should be considered in determining this clearance.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.0">A15.0 Recreation Facilities.</a></p>
<p>Unless otherwise modified in Section 4 or specifically addressed in section 15, all other ADAAG provisions apply for the design and construction of recreation facilities and elements. The provisions in this section apply wherever these elements are provided. For example, office buildings may contain a room with exercise equipment and these sections therefore apply.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.1">A15.1 Amusement Rides.</a> These guidelines apply to newly designed or newly constructed amusement rides. A custom designed and constructed ride is new upon its "first use," which is the first time amusement park patrons take the ride. With respect to amusement rides purchased from other entities, "new" refers to the first permanent installation of the ride, whether it is used "off the shelf" or it is modified before it is installed. Where amusement rides are moved after several seasons to another area of the park or to another park, the ride would not be considered newly designed or newly constructed.</p>
<p>Amusement rides designed primarily for children, amusement rides that are controlled or operated by the rider, and amusement rides without seats, are not required to provide wheelchair spaces, transfer seats, or transfer systems, and need not meet the signage requirements in 15.1.6. The load and unload areas of these rides must, however, be on an accessible route and must provide maneuvering space under 15.1.4 and 15.1.5.</p>
<p>The scoping and technical provisions of the guidelines were developed to address common amusement rides. There will be other amusement attractions that have unique designs and features which are not adequately addressed by the guidelines. In those situations, the guidelines are to be applied to the extent possible.</p>
<p>An accessible route must be provided to these areas. Where an attraction or ride has unique features for which there are no applicable scoping provisions, then a reasonable number, but at least one, of the features must be located on an accessible route. Where there are appropriate technical provisions, they must be applied to the elements that are covered by the scoping provisions. Where an attraction has unique designs for which the technical provisions are not appropriate, the operators of those attractions are still subject to all the other requirements of the ADA, including program accessibility, barrier removal and the general obligation to provide individuals with disabilities an equal opportunity to enjoy the goods and services provided by their facilities. An example of an amusement ride not specifically addressed by the guidelines includes "virtual reality" rides where the device does not move through a fixed course within a defined area.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.1 Exception 1">A15.1 Exception 1.</a> Mobile or temporary rides are those set up for short periods of time such as traveling carnivals, State and county fairs, and festivals. The amusement rides that are covered by section 15.1 are ones that are not regularly assembled and disassembled.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.1 Exception 2">A15.1 Exception 2.</a> The exception does not apply to those rides where patrons may cause the ride to make incidental movements, but where the patron otherwise has no control over the ride.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.1 Exception 3">A15.1 Exception 3.</a> The exception is limited to those rides designed "primarily" for children, where children are assisted on and off the ride by an adult. This exception is limited to those rides designed for children and not for the occasional adult user. An accessible route to and maneuvering space in the load and unload area will provide access for adults and family members assisting children on and off these rides.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.1.2">A15.1.2 Alterations to Amusement Rides.</a> Routine maintenance, painting, and changing of theme boards are examples of activities that do not constitute an alteration subject to section 15.1.2. Where existing amusement rides are moved and not altered, section 15.1 does not apply unless the load and unload area of the amusement ride is newly designed and constructed. If a load or unload area is altered, the alteration provisions of ADAAG 4.1.6 must be applied to the altered area.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.1.4">A15.1.4 Accessible Route.</a> Steeper slopes are permitted (not to exceed 1:8) where the accessible route connects to the amusement ride in the load and unload position. This is permitted only where compliance with 4.8.2 (maximum slope 1:12) is "structurally or operationally infeasible". In most cases, this will be limited to areas where the accessible route leads directly to the amusement ride and where there are space limitations on the ride, not the queue line. Where possible, the least possible slope should be used on the accessible route that serves the amusement ride.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.1.7.1.2">A15.1.7.1.2 Amusement Rides with Wheelchair Spaces.</a> 36 C.F.R. 1192.83(c) ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Transportation Vehicles - Light Rail Vehicles and Systems - Mobility Aid Accessibility is available at www.access-board.gov/transit/html/vguide.htm#LRVM. It references provisions for bridge plates and ramps used for gaps between wheelchair spaces and floors of load and unload areas.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.1.7.2 Exception 3">A15.1.7.2 Exception 3.</a> This exception for protruding objects applies to the ride devices, not to circulation areas or accessible routes in the queue lines or the load and unload areas.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.1.7.2.2">A15.1.7.2.2 Wheelchair Spaces - Side Entry.</a> Under certain circumstances, a 32-inch clear opening will not provide sufficient width to accommodate a turn into an amusement ride. The amount of clear space needed within the ride, and the size and position of the opening are interrelated. Additional space for maneuvering and a wider door will be needed where a side opening is centered on the ride. For example, where a 42-inch opening is provided, a minimum clear space of 60 inches in length and 36 inches in depth is needed (see Fig. A9). This is necessary to ensure adequate space for maneuvering. For additional guidance refer to Figure 3 (Wheelchair Turning Space) and Figure 4 (Minimum Clear Floor Space for Wheelchairs) on minimum space requirements.</p>

<p><a class="black" name="A15.1.8">A15.1.8 Amusement Ride Seats Designed for Transfer.</a> There are many different ways that individuals transfer to and from their wheelchairs or mobility devices. The proximity of the clear floor or ground space next to an element and the height of the element one is transferring to are both critical for a safe and independent transfer. Providing additional clear floor or ground space both in front of and diagonally to the element will provide flexibility and increased usability for a more diverse population of individuals with disabilities. Ride seats designed for transfer should involve only one transfer. Where possible, designers are encouraged to locate the ride seat no higher than 17 to 19 inches above the load and unload surface. Where greater distances are required for transfers, consideration should be given to providing gripping surfaces, seat padding, and avoiding sharp or protruding objects in the path of transfer to better facilitate the transfer process.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.1.9">A15.1.9 Transfer Devices for Use with Amusement Rides.</a> Transfer devices for use with amusement rides should permit individuals to make independent transfers to and from their wheelchairs or mobility devices. There are a variety of transfer devices available that could be adapted to provide access onto an amusement ride. Examples of devices that may provide for transfers include, but are not limited to, transfer systems (see 15.8.8), lifts, mechanized seats, and other custom designed systems. Operators and designers have flexibility in developing designs that will facilitate individuals to transfer onto amusement rides. These systems or devices should be designed to be reliable and sturdy. A transfer board, for example, would not be sufficient because it will not provide enough support or stability and may cause injury.</p>
<p>Designs which limit the number of transfers required from one’s wheelchair or mobility device to the ride seat are encouraged. When using a transfer device to access an amusement ride, the least amount of transfers for the least amount of distance is desired. Where possible, designers are encouraged to locate the transfer device seat no higher than 17 to 19 inches above the load and unload surface. Where greater distances are required for transfers, extra consideration should be given to providing gripping surfaces, seat padding, and avoiding sharp or protruding objects in the path of transfer to better facilitate the transfer process. Where a series of transfers are required to reach the amusement ride seat, each vertical transfer should not exceed 8 inches.</p>
<p>As discussed with amusement rides seats designed for transfer, there are many different ways that individuals transfer to and from their wheelchairs or mobility devices. The proximity of the clear floor or ground space next to an element and the height of the element one is transferring to are both critical for a safe and independent transfer. Providing additional clear floor or ground space both in front of and diagonally to the element will provide flexibility and increased usability for a more diverse population of individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.2">A15.2 Boating Facilities.</a></p>
<p><strong>A15.2.2 Accessible Route.</strong> The following two examples apply exceptions two and three.</p>
<p><em>Example 1.</em> Boat slips which are required to be accessible are provided at a floating pier. The vertical distance an accessible route must travel to the pier when the water is at its lowest level is six feet, although the water level only fluctuates three feet. To comply with exceptions 2 and 3, at least one design solution would provide a gangway at least 72.25 feet long which ensures the slope does not exceed 1:12.</p>
<p><em>Example 2.</em> A gangway is provided to a floating pier which is required to be on an accessible route. The vertical distance is 10 feet between the elevation where the gangway departs the landside connection and the elevation of the pier surface at the lowest water level. Exceptions 2 and 3, which modify 4.8.2, permit the gangway to be at least 80 feet long. Another design solution would be to have two 40-foot plus continuous gangways joined together at a float, where the float (as the water level falls) will stop dropping at an elevation five feet below the landside connection.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.2.3">A15.2.3 Boat Slips: Minimum Number.</a> Accessible boat slips are not "reserved" for persons with disabilities in the same manner as accessible vehicle parking spaces. Rather, accessible boat slip use is comparable to accessible hotel rooms. The Department of Justice is responsible for addressing operational issues relating to the use of accessible facilities and elements. The Department of Justice currently advises that hotels should hold accessible rooms for persons with disabilities until all other rooms are filled. At that point, accessible rooms can be open for general use on a first come, first serve basis.</p>
<p>The following two examples apply to a boating facility with a single non-demarcated pier.</p>
<p><em>Example 1.</em> A site contains a new boating facility which consists of a single 60-foot pier. Boats are only moored parallel with the pier on both sides to allow occupants to embark or disembark. Since the number of slips cannot be identified, section 15.2.3 requires each 40 feet of boat slip edge to be counted as one slip for purposes of determining the number of slips available and determines the number required to be accessible. The 120 feet of boat slip edge at the pier would equate with 3 boat slips. Table 15.2.3 would require 1 slip to be accessible and comply with 15.2.5. Section 15.2.5 (excluding the exceptions within the section) requires a clear pier space 60 inches wide minimum extending the length of the slip. In this example, because the pier is at least 40 feet long, the accessible slip must contain a clear pier space at least 40 feet long which has a minimum width of 60 inches.</p>
<p><em>Example 2.</em> A new boating facility consisting of a single pier 25 feet long and 3 feet wide is being planned for a site. The design intends to allow boats to moor and occupants to embark and disembark on both sides, and at one end. As the number of boat slips cannot be identified, applying section 15.2.3 would translate to 53 feet of boat slip edge at the pier. This equates with two slips. Table 15.2.3 would require 1 slip to be accessible. To comply with 15.2.5 (excluding the exceptions within the section), the width of the pier must be increased to 60 inches. Neither 15.2.3 or 15.2.5 requires the pier length to be increased to 40 feet.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.2.3.1">A15.2.3.1 Dispersion.</a> Types of boat slips are based on the size of the boat slips; whether single berths or double berths, shallow water or deep water, transient or longer-term lease, covered or uncovered; and whether slips are equipped with features such as telephone, water, electricity and cable connections. The term "boat slip" is intended to cover any pier area where recreational boats embark or disembark, unless classified as a launch ramp boarding pier. For example, a fuel pier may contain boat slips, and this type of short term slip would be included in determining compliance with 15.2.3.1.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.2.4">A15.2.4 Boarding Piers at Boat Launch Ramps.</a> The following two examples apply to a boat launch ramp boarding pier.</p>
<p><em>Example 1.</em> A chain of floats is provided on a launch ramp to be used as a boarding pier which is required to be accessible by 15.2.4. At high water, the entire chain is floating and a transition plate connects the first float to the surface of the launch ramp. As the water level decreases, segments of the chain end up resting on the launch ramp surface, matching the slope of the launch ramp. As water levels drop, segments function also as gangways because one end of a segment is resting on the launch ramp surface and the other end is connecting to another floating segment in the chain.</p>
<p>Under ADAAG 4.1.2(2), an accessible route must serve the last float because it would function as the boarding pier at the lowest water level. Under exception 3 in 15.2.4, each float is not required to comply with ADAAG 4.8, but must meet all other requirements in ADAAG 4.3, unless exempted by exception 1 in 15.2.4. In this example, because the entire chain also functions as a boarding pier, the entire chain must comply with the requirements of 15.2.5, including the 60-inch minimum clear pier width provision.</p>
<p><em>Example 2.</em> A non-floating boarding pier supported by piles divides a launching area into two launch ramps and is required to be accessible. Under ADAAG 4.1.2(2), an accessible route must connect the boarding pier with other accessible buildings, facilities, elements, and spaces on the site. Although the boarding pier is located within a launch ramp, because the pier is not a floating pier or a skid pier, none of the exceptions in 15.2.4 apply. To comply with ADAAG 4.3, either the accessible route must run down the launch ramp or the fixed boarding pier could be relocated to the side of the two launch ramps. The second option leaves the slope of the launch ramps unchanged, because the accessible route runs outside the launch ramps.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.2.4.1">A15.2.4.1 Boarding Pier Clearances.</a> The guidelines do not establish a minimum length for accessible boarding piers at boat launch ramps. The accessible boarding pier would have a length which is at least equal to other boarding piers provided at the facility. If no other boarding pier is provided, the pier would have a length equal to what would have been provided if no access requirements applied. The entire length of accessible boarding piers would be required to comply with the same technical provisions that apply to accessible boat slips. For example, at a launch ramp, if a 20-foot long accessible boarding pier is provided, the entire 20 feet must comply with the pier clearance requirements in 15.2.5. Likewise, if a 60-foot long accessible boarding pier is provided, the pier clearance requirements in 15.2.5 would apply to the entire 60 feet.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.2.5">A15.2.5 Accessible Boat Slips.</a> Although the minimum width of the clear pier space is 60 inches, it is recommended that piers be wider than 60 inches to improve the safety for persons with disabilities, particularly on floating piers.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.2.5.1">A15.2.5.1 Clearances, Exception 3.</a> Where the conditions in exception 3 are satisfied, existing facilities are only required to have one accessible boat slip with a pier clearance which runs the length of the slip. All other accessible slips are allowed to have the required pier clearance at the head of the slip. Under this exception, at piers with perpendicular boat slips, the width of most "finger piers" will remain unchanged. However, where mooring systems for floating piers are replaced as part of pier alteration projects, an opportunity may exist for increasing accessibility. Piers may be reconfigured to allow an increase in the number of wider finger piers, and serve as accessible boat slips.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A.15.3">A.15.3 Fishing Piers and Platforms.</a></p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.3.2 ">A15.3.2 Accessible Route, Exception 2.</a> For example, to provide access to an accessible floating fishing pier, a gangway is used. The vertical distance is 60 inches between the elevation that the gangway departs the landside connection and the elevation of the pier surface at the lowest water level. Exception 2 permits the use of a gangway at least 30 feet long, or a series of connecting gangways with a total length of at least 30 feet. The length of transition plates would not be included in determining if the gangway(s) meet the requirements of the exception.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.3.3.1">A15.3.3.1 Edge Protection.</a> Edge protection is required only where railings, guards, or handrails are provided on a fishing pier or platform. Edge protection will prevent wheelchairs or other mobility devices from slipping off the fishing pier or platform. Extending the deck of the fishing pier or platform 12 inches where the 34-inch high railing is provided is an alternative design, permitting individuals using a wheelchair or other mobility device to pull into a clear space and move beyond the face of the railing. In such a design, edge protection is not required.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.3.3.3">A15.3.3.3 Dispersion.</a> Portions of the railings that are lowered to provide fishing opportunities for persons with disabilities must be located in a variety of locations on the fishing pier or platform to give people a variety of locations to fish. Different fishing locations may provide varying water depths, shade (at certain times of the day), vegetation, and proximity to the shoreline or bank.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.4">A15.4 Golf.</a></p>
<p><strong>A15.4.2 Accessible Routes.</strong> The accessible route or golf car passage must serve accessible elements and spaces located within the boundary of a golf course. The 48-inch minimum width for the accessible route is necessary to ensure passage of a golf car on either the accessible route or the golf car passage. This is important where the accessible route is used to connect the golf car rental area, bag drop areas, practice putting greens, accessible practice teeing grounds, course toilet rooms, and course weather shelters. These are areas outside the boundary of the golf course, but are areas where an individual using an adapted golf car may travel. A golf car passage may not be substituted for other accessible routes, required by ADAAG 4.1.2, located outside the boundary of the course. For example, an accessible route connecting an accessible parking space to the entrance of a golf course clubhouse is not covered by this provision.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.4.3">A15.4.3 Accessible Route - Driving Ranges.</a> Both a stand alone driving range or a driving range next to a golf course must provide an accessible route or golf car passage that connects accessible teeing stations with accessible parking spaces. The accessible route must be a minimum width of 48 inches; 60 inches if handrails are provided. The additional width permits the use of a golf car on the accessible route. Providing a golf car passage will permit a person that uses a golf car to practice driving a golf ball from the same position and stance used when playing the game. Additionally, the space required for a person using a golf car to enter and maneuver within the teeing stations required to be accessible should be considered.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.5">A15.5 Miniature Golf.</a> Where possible, providing access to all holes on a miniature golf course is recommended. If a course is designed with the minimum 50 percent accessible holes, designers or operators are encouraged to select holes which provide for an equivalent experience to the maximum extent possible. Accessible holes are required to be consecutive with one break permitted, if the last hole on the course is in the sequence.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.5.3">A15.5.3 Accessible Route.</a> Where only the minimum 50 percent of the holes are accessible, an accessible route from the last accessible hole to the course exit or entrance must not require travel back through other holes. In some cases, this may require an additional route. Other options include increasing the number of accessible holes in a way that limits the distance needed to connect the last accessible hole with the course exit or entrance. In any case, careful consideration to the layout of the course will be important to minimize space impacts.</p>
<p>The 1-inch curb for a 32-inch minimum opening can be located in an area where the ball is less likely to ricochet. Where the accessible route on the hole is provided, steeper slopes are permitted for a limited distance. A landing or level area must separate each of these steeper sloping segments. This will provide a resting area between the steeper segments.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.5.5">A15.5.5 Golf Club Reach Range.</a> Accessible holes on a miniature golf course may be provided with an accessible route leading through the hole or with the accessible route next to the hole. Where the accessible route is provided adjacent to the hole, the route must be located within the golf club reach range. This allows individuals sufficient space and reach to play the game outside of the hole. Where possible, the distance between the level areas and the accessible route should be as close as possible, affording more opportunities for play.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.6">A15.6 Play Areas.</a></p>
<p><strong>A15.6.1 General.</strong> This section is to be applied during the design, construction, and alteration of play areas for children ages 2 and over. Play areas are the portion of a site where play components are provided. This section does not apply to other portions of a site where elements such as sports fields, picnic areas, or other gathering areas are provided. Those areas are addressed by other sections of ADAAG. Play areas may be located on exterior sites or within a building. Where separate play areas are provided within a site for children in specified age groups (e.g., preschool (ages 2 to 5) and school age (ages 5 to 12)), each play area must comply with this section. Where play areas are provided for the same age group on a site but are geographically separated (e.g., one is located next to a picnic area and another is located next to a softball field), they are considered separate play areas and each play area must comply with this section.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.6.2 ">A15.6.2 Ground Level Play Components.</a> A ground level play component is a play component approached and exited at the ground level. Examples of ground level play components include spring rockers, swings, diggers, and stand alone slides. When distinguishing between the different types of ground level play components, consider the general experience provided by the play component. Examples of different types of experiences include, but are not limited to, rocking, swinging, climbing, spinning, and sliding. A spiral slide may provide a slightly different experience from a straight slide, but sliding is the general experience and therefore a spiral slide is not considered a different type of play component than a straight slide.</p>
<p>The number of ground level play components is not dependent on the number of children who can play on the play component. A large seesaw designed to accommodate ten children at once is considered one ground level play component.</p>
<p>Where a large play area includes two or more composite play structures designed for the same age group, the total number of elevated play components on all the composite play structures must be added to determine the additional number and types of ground level play components that must be provided on an accessible route, and the type of accessible route (e.g., ramps or transfer systems) that must be provided to the elevated play components.</p>
<p>Ground level play components accessed by children with disabilities must be integrated in the play area. Designers should consider the optimal layout of ground level play components accessed by children with disabilities to foster interaction and socialization among all children. Grouping all ground level play components accessed by children with disabilities in one location is not considered integrated.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.6.3">A15.6.3 Elevated Play Components.</a> Elevated play components are approached above or below grade and are part of a composite play structure. A double or triple slide that is part of a composite play structure is one elevated play component. For purposes of this section, ramps, transfer systems, steps, decks, and roofs are not considered elevated play components. These elements are generally used to link other elements on a composite play structure. Although socialization and pretend play can occur on these elements, they are not primarily intended for play. Some play components that are attached to a composite play structure can be approached or exited at the ground level or above grade from a platform or deck. For example, a climber attached to a composite play structure can be approached or exited at the ground level or above grade from a platform or deck on a composite play structure. Play components that are attached to a composite play structure and can be approached from a platform or deck (e.g., climbers and overhead play components), are considered elevated play components. These play components are not considered ground level play components also, and do not count toward the requirements in 15.6.2 regarding the number of ground level play components that must be located on an accessible route.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.6.4">A15.6.4 Accessible Routes.</a> Accessible routes within the boundary of the play area must comply with 15.6.4. Accessible routes connecting the play area to parking, drinking fountains, and other elements on a site must comply with 4.3. Accessible routes provide children who use wheelchairs or other mobility devices the opportunity to access play components. Accessible routes should coincide with the general circulation path used within the play area. Careful placement and consideration of the layout of accessible routes will enhance the ability of children with disabilities to socialize and interact with other children.</p>
<p>Where possible, designers and operators are encouraged to provide wider ground level accessible routes within the play area or consider designing the entire ground surface to be accessible. Providing more accessible spaces will enhance the integration of all children within the play area and provide access to more play components. A maximum slope of 1:16 is required for ground level ramps; however, a lesser slope will enhance access for those children who have difficulty negotiating the 1:16 maximum slope. Handrails are not required on ramps located within ground level use zones.</p>
<p>Where a stand alone slide is provided, an accessible route must connect the base of the stairs at the entry point, and the exit point of the slide. A ramp or transfer system to the top of the slide is not required. Where a sand box is provided, an accessible route must connect to the border of the sand box. Accessibility to the sand box would be enhanced by providing a transfer system into the sand or by providing a raised sand table with knee clearance complying with 15.6.6.3.</p>
<p>Elevated accessible routes must connect the entry and exit points of at least 50 percent of elevated play components. Ramps are preferred over transfer systems since not all children who use wheelchairs or other mobility devices may be able to use or may choose not to use transfer systems. Where ramps connect elevated play components, the maximum rise of any ramp run is limited to12 inches. Where possible, designers and operators are encouraged to provide ramps with a lesser slope than the 1:12 maximum. Berms or sculpted dirt may be used to provide elevation and may be part of an accessible route to composite play structures.</p>
<p>Platform lifts complying with 4.11 and applicable State and local codes are permitted as a part of an accessible route. Because lifts must be independently operable, operators should carefully consider the appropriateness of their use in unsupervised settings.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.6.5">A15.6.5 Transfer Systems.</a> Transfer systems are a means of accessing composite play structures. Transfer systems generally include a transfer platform and a series of transfer steps. Children who use wheelchairs or other mobility devices transfer from their wheelchair or mobility devices onto the transfer platform and lift themselves up or down the transfer steps and scoot along the decks or platforms to access elevated play components. Some children may be unable or may choose not to use transfer systems. Where transfer systems are provided, consideration should be given to the distance between the transfer system and the elevated play components. Moving between a transfer platform and a series of transfer steps requires extensive exertion for some children. Designers should minimize the distance between the points where a child transfers from a wheelchair or mobility device and where the elevated play components are located. Where elevated play components are used to connect to another elevated play component in lieu of an accessible route, careful consideration should be used in the selection of the play components used for this purpose. Transfer supports are required on transfer platforms and transfer steps to assist children when transferring. Some examples of supports include a rope loop, a loop type handle, a slot in the edge of a flat horizontal or vertical member, poles or bars, or D rings on the corner posts.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.6.6">A15.6.6 Play Components.</a> Clear floor or ground spaces, maneuvering spaces, and accessible routes may overlap within play areas. A specific location has not been designated for the clear floor or ground spaces or maneuvering spaces, except swings, because each play component may require that the spaces be placed in a unique location. Where play components include a seat or entry point, designs that provide for an unobstructed transfer from a wheelchair or other mobility device are recommended. This will enhance the ability of children with disabilities to independently use the play component.</p>
<p>When designing play components with manipulative or interactive features, consider appropriate reach ranges for children seated in wheelchairs. The following table provides guidance on reach ranges for children seated in wheelchairs. These dimensions apply to either forward or side reaches. The reach ranges are appropriate for use with those play components that children seated in wheelchairs may access and reach. Where transfer systems provide access to elevated play components, the reach ranges are not appropriate.</p>

</div>
<p>Where a climber is located on a ground level accessible route, some of the climbing rings should be within the reach ranges. A careful balance of providing access to play components but not eliminating the challenge and nature of the activity is encouraged.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.6.7">A15.6.7 Ground Surfaces.</a> Ground surfaces along clear floor or ground spaces, maneuvering spaces, and accessible routes must comply with the ASTM F 1951 Standard Specification for Determination of Accessibility of Surface Systems Under and Around Playground Equipment. The ASTM F 1951 standard is available from the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), 100 Barr Harbor Drive, West Conshohocken, PA 19428-2959, telephone (610) 832-9585. The ASTM F 1951 standard may be ordered online from ASTM (<a href="http://www.astm.org">http://www.astm.org</a>). The ASTM 1951 standard determines the accessibility of a surface by measuring the work required to propel a wheelchair across the surface. The standard includes tests of effort for both straight ahead and turning movement, using a force wheel on a rehabilitation wheelchair as the measuring device. To meet the standard, the force required must be less than that required to propel the wheelchair up a ramp with a 1:14 slope. When evaluating ground surfaces, operators should request information about compliance with the ASTM F 1951 standard.</p>
<p>Ground surfaces must be inspected and maintained regularly and frequently to ensure continued compliance with the ASTM F 1951 standard. The type of surface material selected and play area use levels will determine the frequency of inspection and maintenance activities.</p>
<p>When using a combination of surface materials, careful design is necessary to provide appropriate transitions between the surfaces. Where a rubber surface is installed on top of asphalt to provide impact attenuation, the edges of the rubber surface may create a change in level between the adjoining ground surfaces. Where the change in level is greater than ½ inch, a sloped surface with a maximum slope of 1:12 must be provided. Products are commercially available that provide a 1:12 slope at transitions. Transitions are also necessary where the combination of surface materials include loose fill products. Where edging is used to prevent the loose surface from moving onto the firmer surface, the edging may create a tripping hazard. Where possible, the transition should be designed to allow for a smooth and gradual transition between the two surfaces.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.7">A15.7 Exercise Equipment and Machines, Bowling Lanes, and Shooting Facilities.</a></p>
<p><strong>A15.7.2 Exercise Equipment and Machines.</strong> Fitness facilities often provide a range of choices of exercise equipment. At least one of each type of exercise equipment and machine must be served by an accessible route. Most strength training equipment and machines are considered different types. For example, a bench press machine is considered a different type than a biceps curl machine. The requirement for providing access to each type is intended to cover the variety of strength training machines. Where operators provide a biceps curl machine and free weights, both are required to meet the provisions in this section, even though an individual may be able to work on their biceps through both types of equipment. Where the exercise equipment and machines provided are only different in that different manufacturers provide them, only one of each type of machine is required to meet these guidelines. For example, where two bench press machines are provided and each is manufactured by a different company, only one is required to comply.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are many types of cardiovascular exercise machines, such as stationary bicycles, rowing machines, stair climbers, and treadmills. Each machine provides a cardiovascular exercise and is considered a different type for purposes of these guidelines.</p>
<p>One clear floor or ground space is permitted to be shared between two pieces of exercise equipment. Designers should carefully consider layout options to maximize space such as connecting ends of the row and center aisle spaces.</p>
<p>The position of the clear floor space may vary greatly depending on the use of the equipment or machine. For example, to make a shoulder press accessible, clear floor space next to the seat would be appropriate to allow for transfer. Clear floor space for a bench press machine designed for use by an individual seated in a wheelchair, however, will most likely be centered on the operating mechanisms.</p>
<p>Designers and operators are encouraged to select exercise equipment and machines that provide fitness opportunities for persons with lower body extremity disabilities. Upper body exercise equipment and machines that offer either cardiovascular or strength training will enhance fitness opportunities for persons with disabilities from a wheelchair or mobility device. Examples include: equipment or machines that provide arm ergometry, free weights, and weighted pulley systems that are usable from a wheelchair or mobility device.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.7.4">A15.7.4 Shooting Facilities.</a> Examples of different types of firing positions include, but are not limited to: positions having different admission prices, positions with or without weather covering or lighting, and positions supporting different shooting events such as argon, muzzle loading rifle, small bore rifle, high power rifle, bull’s eye pistol, action pistol, silhouette, trap, skeet, and archery (bow and crossbow).</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.8">A15.8</a> Swimming Pools, Wading Pools, and Spas.</p>
<p><strong>A15.8.2 Swimming Pools.</strong> Where more than one means of access is provided into the water, it is recommended that the means be different. Providing different means of access will better serve the varying needs of people with disabilities in getting into and out of a swimming pool. It is also recommended that where two or more means of access are provided, they not be provided in the same location in the pool. Different locations will provide increased options for entry and exit, especially in larger pools.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.8.2">A15.8.2 Swimming Pools, Exception 1.</a> Pool walls at diving areas and areas along pool walls where there is no pool entry because of landscaping or adjacent structures should be counted when determining the number of accessible means of entry required.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.8.5">A15.8.5 Pool Lifts.</a> There are a variety of seats available on pool lifts ranging from sling seats to those that are preformed or molded. Pool lift seats with backs will enable a larger population of persons with disabilities to use the lift. Pool lift seats that consist of materials that resist corrosion and provide a firm base to transfer will be usable by a wider range of people with disabilities. Additional options such as armrests, head rests, seat belts, and leg support will enhance accessibility and better accommodate people with a wide range of disabilities.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.8.5.6">A15.8.5.6 Footrests and Armrests.</a> Footrests are encouraged on lifts used in larger spas, where the foot well water depth is 34 inches or greater. Providing footrests, especially ones that support the entire foot, will facilitate safe and independent transfers by a larger population of persons with disabilities.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.8.5.7">A15.8.5.7 Operation.</a> Pool lifts must be capable of unassisted operation from both the deck and water levels. This will permit a person to call the pool lift when the pool lift is in the opposite position. It is extremely important for a person who is swimming alone to be able to call the pool lift when it is in the up position so he or she will not be stranded in the water for extended periods of time awaiting assistance. The requirement for a pool lift to be independently operable does not preclude assistance from being provided.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.8.5.9">A15.8.5.9 Lifting Capacity.</a> Single person pool lifts must be capable of supporting a minimum weight of 300 pounds and sustaining a static load of at least one and a half times the rated load. Pool lifts should be provided that meet the needs of the population it is serving. Providing a pool lift with a weight capacity greater than 300 pounds may be advisable.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.8.6.1">A15.8.6.1 Sloped Entries.</a> Personal wheelchairs and mobility devices may not be appropriate for submerging in water. Some may have batteries, motors, and electrical systems that when submerged in water may cause damage to the personal mobility device or wheelchair or may contaminate the pool water. Providing an aquatic wheelchair made of non-corrosive materials and designed for access into the water will protect the water from contamination and avoid damage to personal wheelchairs or other mobility aids.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.8.6.3">A15.8.6.3 Handrails.</a> Handrails on both sides of a sloped entry provides stability to both persons with mobility impairments and persons using wheelchairs. For safety reasons, a single handrail is permitted on sloped entries provided at wave action pools, leisure rivers, sand bottom pools, and other pools where user access is limited to one area.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.8.8.4">A15.8.8.4 Transfer Steps.</a> Where possible, the height of the transfer step should be as minimal as possible. This will decrease the distance an individual is required to lift up or move down to reach the next step to gain access.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.8.8.7">A15.8.8.7 Grab Bars.</a> Pool operators have the choice of providing a grab bar on one side of each step and transfer platform or a continuous grab bar on one side serving each transfer step and the transfer platform. If provided on each step, the top of the gripping surface must be 4 to 6 inches above each step. Where a continuous grab bar is provided, the top of the gripping surface must be 4 to 6 inches above the step nosing. Each type has its advantages. A continuous handrail allows the person that is transferring to maintain a constant grip on the handrail while moving up or down the transfer steps. Grab bars provided on each step provide the gripping surface parallel to each step rather than on a diagonal.</p>
<p><a class="black" name="A15.8.10">A15.8.10 Water Play Components.</a> Personal wheelchairs and mobility devices may not be appropriate for submerging in water when accessing play components located in water. Some may have batteries, motors, and electrical systems that when submerged in water may cause damage to the personal mobility device or wheelchair or may contaminate the water. Providing an aquatic wheelchair made of non-corrosive materials and designed for access into the water will protect the water from contamination and avoid damage to personal wheelchairs.</p>
