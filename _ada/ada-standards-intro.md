The ADA standards are issued by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Transportation (DOT) and apply to facilities covered by the ADA in new construction and alterations.   DOJ's standards apply to all facilities covered by the ADA, except public transportation facilities, which are subject to DOT's standards.

Both standards are very similar and are closely based on the Board's ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG).  However, each contains a few unique provisions, which are included in this edition of the standards.
