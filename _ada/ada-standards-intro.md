### Introduction to the ADA standards
The ADA standards are issued by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Transportation (DOT) and apply to facilities covered by the ADA in new construction and alterations.  DOJ's standards apply to all facilities covered by the ADA, except public transportation facilities, which are subject to DOT's standards.

Both standards are very similar and are closely based on the Board's ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG).  However, each contains a few unique provisions, which are included in this edition of the standards.

#### Department of Justice ADA Standards (2010)

DOJ's ADA standards (2010) became mandatory on March 15, 2012.  They include provisions that modify certain portions of Chapters 1-10, including provisions addressing the following areas:

-   Assembly Areas ([221](#ada-221))
-   Medical Care Facilities ([223](#ada-223))
-   Places of Lodging ([224](#ada-224))
-   Housing at Places of Education ([224](#ada-224) and [233](#ada-233))
-   Detention and Correctional Facilities (section [232](#ada-232))

            <p>The Department of Justice published revised regulations for Titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 “ADA” in the Federal Register on September 15, 2010. These regulations adopted revised, enforceable accessibility standards called the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design “2010 Standards” or “Standards”. The 2010 Standards set minimum requirements – both scoping and technical — for newly designed and constructed or altered State and local government facilities, public accommodations, and commercial facilities to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.</p>
            <p>Adoption of the 2010 Standards also establishes a revised reference point for Title II entities that choose to make structural changes to existing facilities to meet their program accessibility requirements; and it establishes a similar reference for Title III entities undertaking readily achievable barrier removal.</p>
            <p>The Department has assembled this online version of the official 2010 Standards to increase its ease of use. This version includes:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>2010 Standards for State and Local Government Facilities Title II</li>
            <li>2010 Standards for Public Accommodations and Commercial Facilities Title III</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Department has assembled into a separate publication the revised regulation guidance that applies to the Standards. The Department included guidance in its revised ADA regulations published on September 15, 2010. This guidance provides detailed information about the Department’s adoption of the 2010 Standards including changes to the Standards, the reasoning behind those changes, and responses to public comments received on these topics. The document, Guidance on the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design, can be downloaded from www.ada.gov</p>

            <h3 id="doj-title-2"><strong>2010 STANDARDS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FACILITIES: TITLE II</strong></h3>
            <p>State and local government facilities must follow the requirements of the 2010 Standards, including both the Title II regulations at 28 CFR 35.151; and the 2004 ADAAG at 36 CFR part 1191, appendices B and D.</p>
            <p>In the few places where requirements between the two differ, the requirements of 28 CFR 35.151 prevail.</p>
            <p><strong>Compliance Date for Title II</strong></p>
            <p>If the start date for construction is on or after March 15, 2012, all newly constructed or altered State and local government facilities must comply with the 2010 Standards. Before that date, the 1991 Standards (without the elevator exemption), the UFAS, or the 2010 Standards may be used for such projects when the start of construction commences on or after September 15, 2010.</p>
            <h4>28 CFR 35.151 New construction and alterations</h4>
            <p><strong>(a) Design and construction.</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(1) Each facility or part of a facility constructed by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity shall be designed and constructed in such manner that the facility or part of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, if the construction was commenced after January 26, 1992.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(2) Exception for structural impracticability.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(i) Full compliance with the requirements of this section is not required where a public entity can demonstrate that it is structurally impracticable to meet the requirements. Full compliance will be considered structurally impracticable only in those rare circumstances when the unique characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility features.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(ii) If full compliance with this section would be structurally impracticable, compliance with this section is required to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable. In that case, any portion of the facility that can be made accessible shall be made accessible to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(iii) If providing accessibility in conformance with this section to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs) would be structurally impracticable, accessibility shall nonetheless be ensured to persons with other types of disabilities, (e.g., those who use crutches or who have sight, hearing, or mental impairments) in accordance with this section.</p>
            <p><strong>(b) Alterations.</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(1) Each facility or part of a facility altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity in a manner that affects or could affect the usability of the facility or part of the facility shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be altered in such manner that the altered portion of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, if the alteration was commenced after January 26, 1992.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(2) The path of travel requirements of § 35.151(b)(4) shall apply only to alterations undertaken solely for purposes other than to meet the program accessibility requirements of § 35.150.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(3)</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(i) Alterations to historic properties shall comply, to the maximum extent feasible, with the provisions applicable to historic properties in the design standards specified in § 35.151(c).</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(ii) If it is not feasible to provide physical access to an historic property in a manner that will not threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or facility, alternative methods of access shall be provided pursuant to the requirements of § 35.150.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(4) Path of travel. An alteration that affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area of a facility that contains a primary function shall be made so as to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered area and the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, unless the cost and scope of such alterations is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(i) Primary function. A “primary function” is a major activity for which the facility is intended. Areas that contain a primary function include, but are not limited to, the dining area of a cafeteria, the meeting rooms in a conference center, as well as offices and other work areas in which the activities of the public entity using the facility are carried out.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(A) Mechanical rooms, boiler rooms, supply storage rooms, employee lounges or locker rooms, janitorial closets, entrances, and corridors are not areas containing a primary function. Restrooms are not areas containing a primary function unless the provision of restrooms is a primary purpose of the area, e.g., in highway rest stops.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(B) For the purposes of this section, alterations to windows, hardware, controls, electrical outlets, and signage shall not be deemed to be alterations that affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(ii) A “path of travel” includes a continuous, unobstructed way of pedestrian passage by means of which the altered area may be approached, entered, and exited, and which connects the altered area with an exterior approach (including sidewalks, streets, and parking areas), an entrance to the facility, and other parts of the facility.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(A) An accessible path of travel may consist of walks and sidewalks, curb ramps and other interior or exterior pedestrian ramps; clear floor paths through lobbies, corridors, rooms, and other improved areas; parking access aisles; elevators and lifts; or a combination of these elements.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(B) For the purposes of this section, the term “path of travel” also includes the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(C) Safe harbor. If a public entity has constructed or altered required elements of a path of travel in accordance with the specifications in either the 1991 Standards or the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards before March 15, 2012, the public entity is not required to retrofit such elements to reflect incremental changes in the 2010 Standards solely because of an alteration to a primary function area served by that path of travel.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(iii) Disproportionality.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(A) Alterations made to provide an accessible path of travel to the altered area will be deemed disproportionate to the overall alteration when the cost exceeds 20 % of the cost of the alteration to the primary function area.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(B) Costs that may be counted as expenditures required to provide an accessible path of travel may include:</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 120px;">(1) Costs associated with providing an accessible entrance and an accessible route to the altered area, for example, the cost of widening doorways or installing ramps;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 120px;">(2) Costs associated with making restrooms accessible, such as installing grab bars, enlarging toilet stalls, insulating pipes, or installing accessible faucet controls;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 120px;">(3) Costs associated with providing accessible telephones, such as relocating the telephone to an accessible height, installing amplification devices, or installing a text telephone (TTY); and</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 120px;">(4) Costs associated with relocating an inaccessible drinking fountain.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(iv) Duty to provide accessible features in the event of disproportionality.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(A) When the cost of alterations necessary to make the path of travel to the altered area fully accessible is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration, the path of travel shall be made accessible to the extent that it can be made accessible without incurring disproportionate costs.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(B) In choosing which accessible elements to provide, priority should be given to those elements that will provide the greatest access, in the following order—</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 120px;">(1) An accessible entrance; <br>(2) An accessible route to the altered area; <br>(3) At least one accessible restroom for each sex or a single unisex restroom; <br>(4) Accessible telephones; <br>(5) Accessible drinking fountains; and <br>(6) When possible, additional accessible elements such as parking, storage, and alarms.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;"><br>(v) Series of smaller alterations.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(A) The obligation to provide an accessible path of travel may not be evaded by performing a series of small alterations to the area served by a single path of travel if those alterations could have been performed as a single undertaking.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(B)</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 120px;">(1) If an area containing a primary function has been altered without providing an accessible path of travel to that area, and subsequent alterations of that area, or a different area on the same path of travel, are undertaken within three years of the original alteration, the total cost of alterations to the primary function areas on that path of travel during the preceding three-year period shall be considered in determining whether the cost of making that path of travel accessible is disproportionate.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 120px;">(2) Only alterations undertaken on or after March 15, 2011, shall be considered in determining if the cost of providing an accessible path of travel is disproportionate to the overall cost of the alterations.</p>
            <p><strong>(c) Accessibility standards and compliance date.</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(1) If physical construction or alterations commence after July 26, 1992, but prior to the September 15, 2010, then new construction and alterations subject to this section must comply with either the UFAS or the 1991 Standards except that the elevator exemption contained at section 4.1.3(5) and section 4.1.6(1)(k) of the 1991 Standards shall not apply. Departures from particular requirements of either standard by the use of other methods shall be permitted when it is clearly evident that equivalent access to the facility or part of the facility is thereby provided.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(2) If physical construction or alterations commence on or after September 15, 2010, and before March 15, 2012, then new construction and alterations subject to this section may comply with one of the following: the 2010 Standards, UFAS, or the 1991 Standards except that the elevator exemption contained at section 4.1.3(5) and section 4.1.6(1)(k) of the 1991 Standards shall not apply. Departures from particular requirements of either standard by the use of other methods shall be permitted when it is clearly evident that equivalent access to the facility or part of the facility is thereby provided.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(3) If physical construction or alterations commence on or after March 15, 2012, then new construction and alterations subject to this section shall comply with the 2010 Standards.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(4) For the purposes of this section, ceremonial groundbreaking or razing of structures prior to site preparation do not commence physical construction or alterations.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(5) Noncomplying new construction and alterations.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(i) Newly constructed or altered facilities or elements covered by §§ 35.151(a) or (b) that were constructed or altered before March 15, 2012, and that do not comply with the 1991 Standards or with UFAS shall before March 15, 2012, be made accessible in accordance with either the 1991 Standards, UFAS, or the 2010 Standards.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(ii) Newly constructed or altered facilities or elements covered by §§ 35.151(a) or (b) that were constructed or altered before March 15, 2012 and that do not comply with the 1991 Standards or with UFAS shall, on or after March 15, 2012, be made accessible in accordance with the 2010 Standards.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(2) The requirements of paragraph (1) also apply to housing programs that are operated by public entities where design and construction of particular residential dwelling units take place only after a specific buyer has been identified. In such programs, the covered entity must provide the units that comply with the requirements for accessible features to those pre-identified buyers with disabilities who have requested such a unit.</p>
            <p><strong>(k) Detention and correctional facilities.</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(1) New construction of jails, prisons, and other detention and correctional facilities shall comply with the 2010 Standards except that public entities shall provide accessible mobility features complying with section 807.2 of the 2010 Standards for a minimum of 3%, but no fewer than one, of the total number of cells in a facility. Cells with mobility features shall be provided in each classification level.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(2) Alterations to detention and correctional facilities. Alterations to jails, prisons, and other detention and correctional facilities shall comply with the 2010 Standards except that public entities shall provide accessible mobility features complying with section 807.2 of the 2010 Standards for a minimum of 3%, but no fewer than one, of the total number of cells being altered until at least 3%, but no fewer than one, of the total number of cells in a facility shall provide mobility features complying with section 807.2. Altered cells with mobility features shall be provided in each classification level. However, when alterations are made to specific cells, detention and correctional facility operators may satisfy their obligation to provide the required number of cells with mobility features by providing the required mobility features in substitute cells (cells other than those where alterations are originally planned), provided that each substitute cell—</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(i) Is located within the same prison site;</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(iii) Has, at a minimum, equal physical access as the altered cells to areas used by inmates or detainees for visitation, dining, recreation, educational programs, medical services, work programs, religious services, and participation in other programs that the facility offers to inmates or detainees; and,</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(iv) If it is technically infeasible to locate a substitute cell within the same prison site, a substitute cell must be provided at another prison site within the corrections system.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(3) With respect to medical and long-term care facilities in jails, prisons, and other detention and correctional facilities, public entities shall apply the 2010 Standards technical and scoping requirements for those facilities irrespective of whether those facilities are licensed.</p>

            <h3 id="doj-title-3"><strong>2010 STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS AND COMMERCIAL FACILITIES: TITLE III</strong></h3>
            <p><br>Public accommodations and commercial facilities must follow the requirements of the 2010 Standards, including both the Title III regulations at 28 CFR part 36, subpart D; and the 2004 ADAAG at 36 CFR part 1191, appendices B and D.</p>
            <p>In the few places where requirements between the two differ, the requirements of 28 CFR part 36, subpart D prevail.</p>
            <p>Compliance Date for Title III</p>
            <p>The compliance date for the 2010 Standards for new construction and alterations is determined by:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the date the last application for a building permit or permit extension is certified to be complete by a State, county, or local government;</li>
            <li>the date the last application for a building permit or permit extension is received by a State, county, or local government, where the government does not certify the completion of applications; or</li>
            <li>the start of physical construction or alteration, if no permit is required.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If that date is on or after March 15, 2012, then new construction and alterations must comply with the 2010 Standards. If that date is on or after September 15, 2010, and before March 15, 2012, then new construction and alterations must comply with either the 1991 or the 2010 Standards.</p>

            <h4>28 CFR part 36, subpart D – New Construction and Alterations</h4>
            <p><strong>§36.401 New construction.</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(a) General.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, discrimination for purposes of this part includes a failure to design and construct facilities for first occupancy after January 26, 1993, that are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(2) For purposes of this section, a facility is designed and constructed for first occupancy after January 26, 1993, only –</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(i) If the last application for a building permit or permit extension for the facility is certified to be complete, by a State, County, or local government after January 26, 1992 (or, in those jurisdictions where the government does not certify completion of applications, if the last application for a building permit or permit extension for the facility is received by the State, County, or local government after January 26, 1992); and</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(ii) If the first certificate of occupancy for the facility is issued after January 26, 1993.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(b) Commercial facilities located in private residences.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(1) When a commercial facility is located in a private residence, the portion of the residence used exclusively as a residence is not covered by this subpart, but that portion used exclusively in the operation of the commercial facility or that portion used both for the commercial facility and for residential purposes is covered by the new construction and alterations requirements of this subpart.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(2) The portion of the residence covered under paragraph (b)(1) of this section extends to those elements used to enter the commercial facility, including the homeowner´s front sidewalk, if any, the door or entryway, and hallways; and those portions of the residence, interior or exterior, available to or used by employees or visitors of the commercial facility, including restrooms.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(c) Exception for structural impracticability.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(1) Full compliance with the requirements of this section is not required where an entity can demonstrate that it is structurally impracticable to meet the requirements. Full compliance will be considered structurally impracticable only in those rare circumstances when the unique characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility features.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(2) If full compliance with this section would be structurally impracticable, compliance with this section is required to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable. In that case, any portion of the facility that can be made accessible shall be made accessible to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(3) If providing accessibility in conformance with this section to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs) would be structurally impracticable, accessibility shall nonetheless be ensured to persons with other types of disabilities (e.g., those who use crutches or who have sight, hearing, or mental impairments) in accordance with this section.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(d) Elevator exemption.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(1) For purposes of this paragraph (d) –</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(i) Professional office of a health care provider means a location where a person or entity regulated by a State to provide professional services related to the physical or mental health of an individual makes such services available to the public. The facility housing the "professional office of a health care provider" only includes floor levels housing at least one health care provider, or any floor level designed or intended for use by at least one health care provider.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(ii) Shopping center or shopping mall means –</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 120px;">(A) A building housing five or more sales or rental establishments; or</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 120px;">(B) A series of buildings on a common site, either under common ownership or common control or developed either as one project or as a series of related projects, housing five or more sales or rental establishments. For purposes of this section, places of public accommodation of the types listed in paragraph (5) of the definition of "place of public accommodation" in section § 36.104 are considered sales or rental establishments. The facility housing a "shopping center or shopping mall" only includes floor levels housing at least one sales or rental establishment, or any floor level designed or intended for use by at least one sales or rental establishment.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(2) This section does not require the installation of an elevator in a facility that is less than three stories or has less than 3000 square feet per story, except with respect to any facility that houses one or more of the following:</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(i) A shopping center or shopping mall, or a professional office of a health care provider.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(ii) A terminal, depot, or other station used for specified public transportation, or an airport passenger terminal. In such a facility, any area housing passenger services, including boarding and debarking, loading and unloading, baggage claim, dining facilities, and other common areas open to the public, must be on an accessible route from an accessible entrance.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(3) The elevator exemption set forth in this paragraph (d) does not obviate or limit, in any way the obligation to comply with the other accessibility requirements established in paragraph (a) of this section. For example, in a facility that houses a shopping center or shopping mall, or a professional office of a health care provider, the floors that are above or below an accessible ground floor and that do not house sales or rental establishments or a professional office of a health care provider, must meet the requirements of this section but for the elevator.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>§36.402 Alterations.</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(a) General.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(1) Any alteration to a place of public accommodation or a commercial facility, after January 26, 1992, shall be made so as to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the altered portions of the facility are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(2) An alteration is deemed to be undertaken after January 26, 1992, if the physical alteration of the property begins after that date.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(b) Alteration. For the purposes of this part, an alteration is a change to a place of public accommodation or a commercial facility that affects or could affect the usability of the building or facility or any part thereof.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(1) Alterations include, but are not limited to, remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, historic restoration, changes or rearrangement in structural parts or elements, and changes or rearrangement in the plan configuration of walls and full-height partitions. Normal maintenance, reroofing, painting or wallpapering, asbestos removal, or changes to mechanical and electrical systems are not alterations unless they affect the usability of the building or facility.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(2) If existing elements, spaces, or common areas are altered, then each such altered element, space, or area shall comply with the applicable provisions of appendix A to this part.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(c) To the maximum extent feasible. The phrase "to the maximum extent feasible," as used in this section, applies to the occasional case where the nature of an existing facility makes it virtually impossible to comply fully with applicable accessibility standards through a planned alteration. In these circumstances, the alteration shall provide the maximum physical accessibility feasible. Any altered features of the facility that can be made accessible shall be made accessible. If providing accessibility in conformance with this section to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs) would not be feasible, the facility shall be made accessible to persons with other types of disabilities (e.g., those who use crutches, those who have impaired vision or hearing, or those who have other impairments).</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>§36.403 Alterations: Path of travel.</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(a) General.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(1) An alteration that affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area of a facility that contains a primary function shall be made so as to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered area and the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area, are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, unless the cost and scope of such alterations is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(2) If a private entity has constructed or altered required elements of a path of travel at a place of public accommodation or commercial facility in accordance with the specifications in the 1991 Standards, the private entity is not required to retrofit such elements to reflect the incremental changes in the 2010 Standards solely because of an alteration to a primary function area served by that path of travel.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(b) Primary function. A "primary function" is a major activity for which the facility is intended. Areas that contain a primary function include, but are not limited to, the customer services lobby of a bank, the dining area of a cafeteria, the meeting rooms in a conference center, as well as offices and other work areas in which the activities of the public accommodation or other private entity using the facility are carried out. Mechanical rooms, boiler rooms, supply storage rooms, employee lounges or locker rooms, janitorial closets, entrances, corridors, and restrooms are not areas containing a primary function.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(c) Alterations to an area containing a primary function.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(1) Alterations that affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function include, but are not limited to –</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(i) Remodeling merchandise display areas or employee work areas in a department store;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(ii) Replacing an inaccessible floor surface in the customer service or employee work areas of a bank;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(iii) Redesigning the assembly line area of a factory; or</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(iv) Installing a computer center in an accounting firm.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(2) For the purposes of this section, alterations to windows, hardware, controls, electrical outlets, and signage shall not be deemed to be alterations that affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(d) Landlord/tenant: If a tenant is making alterations as defined in § 36.402 that would trigger the requirements of this section, those alterations by the tenant in areas that only the tenant occupies do not trigger a path of travel obligation upon the landlord with respect to areas of the facility under the landlord´s authority, if those areas are not otherwise being altered.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(e) Path of travel.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(1) A "path of travel" includes a continuous, unobstructed way of pedestrian passage by means of which the altered area may be approached, entered, and exited, and which connects the altered area with an exterior approach (including sidewalks, streets, and parking areas), an entrance to the facility, and other parts of the facility.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(2) An accessible path of travel may consist of walks and sidewalks, curb ramps and other interior or exterior pedestrian ramps; clear floor paths through lobbies, corridors, rooms, and other improved areas; parking access aisles; elevators and lifts; or a combination of these elements.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(3) For the purposes of this part, the term "path of travel" also includes the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(f) Disproportionality.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(1) Alterations made to provide an accessible path of travel to the altered area will be deemed disproportionate to the overall alteration when the cost exceeds 20% of the cost of the alteration to the primary function area.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(2) Costs that may be counted as expenditures required to provide an accessible path of travel may include:</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(i) Costs associated with providing an accessible entrance and an accessible route to the altered area, for example, the cost of widening doorways or installing ramps;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(ii) Costs associated with making restrooms accessible, such as installing grab bars, enlarging toilet stalls, insulating pipes, or installing accessible faucet controls;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(iii) Costs associated with providing accessible telephones, such as relocating the telephone to an accessible height, installing amplification devices, or installing a text telephone (TTY);</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(iv) Costs associated with relocating an inaccessible drinking fountain.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><br>(g) Duty to provide accessible features in the event of disproportionality.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(1) When the cost of alterations necessary to make the path of travel to the altered area fully accessible is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration, the path of travel shall be made accessible to the extent that it can be made accessible without incurring disproportionate costs.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(2) In choosing which accessible elements to provide, priority should be given to those elements that will provide the greatest access, in the following order:</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(i) An accessible entrance; <br>(ii) An accessible route to the altered area; <br>(iii) At least one accessible restroom for each sex or a single unisex restroom; <br>(iv) Accessible telephones; <br>(v) Accessible drinking fountains; and <br>(vi) When possible, additional accessible elements such as parking, storage, and alarms.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(h) Series of smaller alterations.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(1) The obligation to provide an accessible path of travel may not be evaded by performing a series of small alterations to the area served by a single path of travel if those alterations could have been performed as a single undertaking.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(2)</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(i) If an area containing a primary function has been altered without providing an accessible path of travel to that area, and subsequent alterations of that area, or a different area on the same path of travel, are undertaken within three years of the original alteration, the total cost of alterations to the primary function areas on that path of travel during the preceding three year period shall be considered in determining whether the cost of making that path of travel accessible is disproportionate.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(ii) Only alterations undertaken after January 26, 1992, shall be considered in determining if the cost of providing an accessible path of travel is disproportionate to the overall cost of the alterations.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>§36.404 Alterations: Elevator exemption.</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(a) This section does not require the installation of an elevator in an altered facility that is less than three stories or has less than 3,000 square feet per story, except with respect to any facility that houses a shopping center, a shopping mall, the professional office of a health care provider, a terminal, depot, or other station used for specified public transportation, or an airport passenger terminal.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(1) For the purposes of this section, professional office of a health care provider means a location where a person or entity regulated by a State to provide professional services related to the physical or mental health of an individual makes such services available to the public. The facility that houses a professional office of a health care provider only includes floor levels housing by at least one health care provider, or any floor level designed or intended for use by at least one health care provider.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">(2) For the purposes of this section, shopping center or shopping mall means –</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(i) A building housing five or more sales or rental establishments; or</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 90px;">(ii) A series of buildings on a common site, connected by a common pedestrian access route above or below the ground floor, that is either under common ownership or common control or developed either as one project or as a series of related projects, housing five or more sales or rental establishments. For purposes of this section, places of public accommodation of the types listed in paragraph (5) of the definition of place of public accommodation in § 36.104 are considered sales or rental establishments. The facility housing a "shopping center or shopping mall" only includes floor levels housing at least one sales or rental establishment, or any floor level designed or intended for use by at least one sales or rental establishment.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(b) The exemption provided in paragraph (a) of this section does not obviate or limit in any way the obligation to comply with the other accessibility requirements established in this subpart. For example, alterations to floors above or below the accessible ground floor must be accessible regardless of whether the altered facility has an elevator.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>§36.405 Alterations: Historic preservation.</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(a) Alterations to buildings or facilities that are eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places under the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.) or are designated as historic under State or local law, shall comply to the maximum extent feasible with this part.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">(b) If it is determined that it is not feasible to provide physical access to an historic property that is a place of public accommodation in a manner that will not threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or the facility, alternative methods of access shall be provided pursuant to the requirements of subpart C of this part.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
