<p class="advisory">Advisory 502.3.3 Marking.&nbsp; The method and color of marking are not specified by these requirements but may be addressed by State or local laws or regulations.&nbsp; Because these requirements permit the van access aisle to be as wide as a parking space, it is important that the aisle be clearly marked.</p>

<p class="advisory">Advisory 502.3.4 Location.&nbsp; Wheelchair lifts typically are installed on the passenger side of vans.&nbsp; Many drivers, especially those who operate vans, find it more difficult to back into parking spaces than to back out into comparatively unrestricted vehicular lanes.&nbsp; For this reason, where a van and car share an access aisle, consider locating the van space so that the access aisle is on the passenger side of the van space.</p>

<p class="advisory">Advisory 502.4 Floor or Ground Surfaces.&nbsp; Access aisles are required to be nearly level in all directions to provide a surface for wheelchair transfer to and from vehicles.&nbsp; The exception allows sufficient slope for drainage.&nbsp; Built-up curb ramps are not permitted to project into access aisles and parking spaces because they would create slopes greater than 1:48.</p>

<p class="advisory">Advisory 505.4 Height.&nbsp; The requirements for stair and ramp handrails in this document are for adults.&nbsp; When children are the principal users in a building or facility (e.g., elementary schools), a second set of handrails at an appropriate height can assist them and aid in preventing accidents.&nbsp; A maximum height of 28 inches (710 mm) measured to the top of the gripping surface from the ramp surface or stair nosing is recommended for handrails designed for children.&nbsp; Sufficient vertical clearance between upper and lower handrails, 9 inches (230 mm) minimum, should be provided to help prevent entrapment.</p>
