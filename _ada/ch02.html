<p class="advisory">Advisory 221.2.1.2 Luxury Boxes, Club Boxes, and Suites in Arenas, Stadiums, and Grandstands.&nbsp; The number of wheelchair spaces required in luxury boxes, club boxes, and suites within an arena, stadium, or grandstand is to be calculated box by box and suite by suite.</p>
<p id="a221213">221.2.1.3 Other Boxes.&nbsp; In boxes other than those required to comply with 221.2.1.2, the total number of wheelchair spaces required shall be determined in accordance with Table 221.2.1.1.&nbsp; Wheelchair spaces shall be located in not less than 20 percent of all boxes provided.&nbsp; Wheelchair spaces shall comply with 802.1.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory 221.2.1.3 Other Boxes.&nbsp; The provision for seating in "other boxes" includes box seating provided in facilities such as performing arts auditoria where tiered boxes are designed for spatial and acoustical purposes.&nbsp; The number of wheelchair spaces required in boxes covered by 221.2.1.3 is calculated based on the total number of seats provided in these other boxes.&nbsp; The resulting number of wheelchair spaces must be located in no fewer than 20% of the boxes covered by this section.&nbsp; For example, a concert hall has 20 boxes, each of which contains 10 seats, totaling 200 seats.&nbsp; In this example, 5 wheelchair spaces would be required, and they must be placed in at least 4 of the boxes. Additionally, because the wheelchair spaces must also meet the dispersion requirements of 221.2.3, the boxes containing these wheelchair spaces cannot all be located in one area unless an exception to the dispersion requirements applies.</p>
<p id="a221214">221.2.1.4 Team or Player Seating.&nbsp; At least one wheelchair space complying with 802.1 shall be provided in team or player seating areas serving areas of sport activity.</p>

<p id="a22122">221.2.2 Integration.&nbsp; Wheelchair spaces shall be an integral part of the seating plan.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory 221.2.2 Integration.&nbsp; The requirement that wheelchair spaces be an "integral part of the seating plan" means that wheelchair spaces must be placed within the footprint of the seating area.&nbsp; Wheelchair spaces cannot be segregated from seating areas.&nbsp; For example, it would be unacceptable to place only the wheelchair spaces, or only the wheelchair spaces and their associated companion seats, outside the seating areas defined by risers in an assembly area.</p>
<p id="a22123">221.2.3 Lines of Sight and Dispersion.&nbsp; Wheelchair spaces shall provide lines of sight complying with 802.2 and shall comply with 221.2.3.&nbsp; In providing lines of sight, wheelchair spaces shall be dispersed.&nbsp; Wheelchair spaces shall provide spectators with choices of seating locations and viewing angles that are substantially equivalent to, or better than, the choices of seating locations and viewing angles available to all other spectators.&nbsp; When the number of wheelchair spaces required by 221.2.1 has been met, further dispersion shall not be required.</p>
<p>EXCEPTION:&nbsp; Wheelchair spaces in team or player seating areas serving areas of sport activity shall not be required to comply with 221.2.3.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory 221.2.3 Lines of Sight and Dispersion.&nbsp; Consistent with the overall intent of the ADA, individuals who use wheelchairs must be provided equal access so that their experience is substantially equivalent to that of other members of the audience.&nbsp; Thus, while individuals who use wheelchairs need not be provided with the best seats in the house, neither may they be relegated to the worst.</p>
<p id="a221231">221.2.3.1 Horizontal Dispersion.&nbsp; Wheelchair spaces shall be dispersed horizontally.</p>
<p>EXCEPTIONS:&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Horizontal dispersion shall not be required in assembly areas with 300 or fewer seats if the companion seats required by 221.3 and wheelchair spaces are located within the 2nd or 3rd quartile of the total row length.&nbsp; Intermediate aisles shall be included in determining the total row length.&nbsp; If the row length in the 2nd and 3rd quartile of a row is insufficient to accommodate the required number of companion seats and wheelchair spaces, the additional companion seats and wheelchair spaces shall be permitted to be located in the 1st and 4th quartile of the row.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; In row seating, two wheelchair spaces shall be permitted to be located side-by-side.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory 221.2.3.1 Horizontal Dispersion.&nbsp; Horizontal dispersion of wheelchair spaces is the placement of spaces in an assembly facility seating area from side-to-side or, in the case of an arena or stadium, around the field of play or performance area.</p>
<p id="a221232">221.2.3.2 Vertical Dispersion.&nbsp; Wheelchair spaces shall be dispersed vertically at varying distances from the screen, performance area, or playing field.&nbsp; In addition, wheelchair spaces shall be located in each balcony or mezzanine that is located on an <cite title="A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with this part.">accessible</cite> route.</p>
<p>EXCEPTIONS:&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Vertical dispersion shall not be required in assembly areas with 300 or fewer seats if the wheelchair spaces provide viewing angles that are equivalent to, or better than, the average viewing angle provided in the facility.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; In bleachers, wheelchair spaces shall not be required to be provided in rows other than rows at points of entry to bleacher seating.</p>
<div class="advisory">
<p class="first">Advisory 221.2.3.2 Vertical Dispersion.&nbsp; When wheelchair spaces are dispersed vertically in an assembly facility they are placed at different locations within the seating area from front-to-back so that the distance from the screen, stage, playing field, area of sports activity, or other focal point is varied among wheelchair spaces.</p>
<p class="last">Advisory 221.2.3.2 Vertical Dispersion Exception 2.&nbsp; Points of entry to bleacher seating may include, but are not limited to, cross aisles, concourses, vomitories, and entrance ramps and stairs.&nbsp; Vertical, center, or side aisles adjoining bleacher seating that are stepped or tiered are not considered entry points.</p>

<div class="advisory">
<p class="first">Advisory 240.2.1 Ground Level Play Components.&nbsp; Examples of ground level play components may include spring rockers, swings, diggers, and stand-alone slides.&nbsp; When distinguishing between the different types of ground level play components, consider the general experience provided by the play component.&nbsp; Examples of different types of experiences include, but are not limited to, rocking, swinging, climbing, spinning, and sliding.&nbsp; A spiral slide may provide a slightly different experience from a straight slide, but sliding is the general experience and therefore a spiral slide is not considered a different type of play component from a straight slide.</p>
<p>Ground level play components accessed by children with disabilities must be integrated into the play area.&nbsp; Designers should consider the optimal layout of ground level play components accessed by children with disabilities to foster interaction and socialization among all children. Grouping all ground level play components accessed by children with disabilities in one location is not considered integrated.</p>
<p>Where a stand-alone slide is provided, an <cite title="A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with this part.">accessible</cite> route must connect the base of the stairs at the entry point to the exit point of the slide.&nbsp; A ramp or transfer system to the top of the slide is not required.&nbsp; Where a sand box is provided, an <cite title="A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with this part.">accessible</cite> route must connect to the border of the sand box.&nbsp; Accessibility to the sand box would be enhanced by providing a transfer system into the sand or by providing a raised sand table with knee clearance complying with 1008.4.3.</p>
<p>Ramps are preferred over transfer systems since not all children who use wheelchairs or other mobility devices may be able to use, or may choose not to use, transfer systems.&nbsp; Where ramps connect elevated play components, the maximum rise of any ramp run is limited to 12 inches (305 mm).&nbsp; Where possible, designers and operators are encouraged to provide ramps with a slope less than the 1:12 maximum.&nbsp; Berms or sculpted dirt may be used to provide elevation and may be part of an <cite title="A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with this part.">accessible</cite> route to composite play structures.</p>
