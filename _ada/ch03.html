<p id="a3011">301.1 Scope.&nbsp; The provisions of Chapter 3 shall apply where required by Chapter 2 or where referenced by a requirement in this document.</p>
<h3 id="a301"><a name="302 Floor or Ground Surfaces"></a>302 Floor or Ground Surfaces</h3>
<p id="a3021">302.1 General.&nbsp; Floor and ground surfaces shall be stable, firm, and slip resistant and shall comply with 302.</p>
<p>EXCEPTIONS:&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Within animal containment areas, floor and ground surfaces shall not be required to be stable, firm, and slip resistant.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Areas of sport activity shall not be required to comply with 302.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory 302.1 General.&nbsp; A stable surface is one that remains unchanged by contaminants or applied force, so that when the contaminant or force is removed, the surface returns to its original condition.&nbsp; A firm surface resists deformation by either indentations or particles moving on its surface.&nbsp; A slip-resistant surface provides sufficient frictional counterforce to the forces exerted in walking to permit safe ambulation.</p>
<p id="a3022">302.2 Carpet.&nbsp; Carpet or carpet tile shall be securely attached and shall have a firm cushion, pad, or backing or no cushion or pad.&nbsp; Carpet or carpet tile shall have a level loop, textured loop, level cut pile, or level cut/uncut pile texture.&nbsp; Pile height shall be ½ inch (13 mm) maximum.&nbsp; Exposed edges of carpet shall be fastened to floor surfaces and shall have trim on the entire length of the exposed edge.&nbsp; Carpet edge trim shall comply with 303.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory 302.2 Carpet.&nbsp; Carpets and permanently affixed mats can significantly increase the amount of force (roll resistance) needed to propel a wheelchair over a surface. The firmer the carpeting and backing, the lower the roll resistance.&nbsp; A pile thickness up to ½ inch (13 mm) (measured to the backing, cushion, or pad) is allowed, although a lower pile provides easier wheelchair maneuvering.&nbsp; If a backing, cushion or pad is used, it must be firm.&nbsp; Preferably, carpet pad should not be used because the soft padding increases roll resistance.</p>
