<h2> {{ page.title }} </h2>
<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p> The National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the
  Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx®) initiative
  to speed innovation, development, commercialization,
  and implementation of COVID-19 testing technologies.
  The RADx Tech program, one arm of the initiative,
  was specifically designed to compress the customary
  technology development timeline from years down to
  just months. While these programs have increased
  testing capacity in the U.S. by billions, there is a
  continuing need to develop at-home COVID-19 tests
  that are accessible to all users including populations
  that have no or low vision, a reduced range of dexterity
  or motor skills, and that are aging. </p>
<p> Within RADx Tech, the RADx Deployment Core
  has focused on increasing accessibility of at-home
  COVID-19 tests. As first steps, research was
  conducted to locate pre-existing accessible product
  design guidelines and engineering design groups
  were consulted. One of the immediate and surprising
  insights to come from these efforts was the lack of
  comprehensive in vitro diagnostic (IVD) guidelines or
  standards for accessible design of in vitro diagnostic
  (IVD) products for manufacturers and engineers.
  Advocacy groups and foundations that have a deep
  base of knowledge on the experience and needs of
  people with these types of challenges were engaged. </p>
<p> Due to the lack of fully accessible at-home COVID-19
  tests, a research funding program was created with
  the purpose of developing more accessible tests.
  Through this effort, members of advocacy groups
  continue to be engaged to help provide feedback on
  device usability and work through design challenges
  for these populations. RADx Tech experts are actively
  working with manufacturers to address device design,
  packaging, and modes of instruction, among other
  challenges.</p>
<p> Through knowledge garnered from all the above
  actions, a comprehensive, practical and useful set
  of Best Practice Recommendations was created to help 
  fill a critical need in the design community. It
  is intended that this document will be used primarily
  by manufacturers for designing more accessible
  IVDs. While the goal of the document is to provide
  recommendations for making an at-home diagnostic
  kit accessible to aging populations and/or users with 
  visual/motor disabilities, many of the recommendations
  will improve the overall usability and will likely result in
  universal access to the test kit. The document will be hosted 
  by U.S. Access Board on their website and is
  scheduled for release in the first half of 2023. </p>
<p> When this work began, it was recognized that there
  was a need to provide information to the manufacturing
  and engineering communities as soon as possible.
  This document is an abridged version of Best Practice
  Recommendations, and covers topics prioritized for
  early release. </p>

<h4> Instructions/Accessing Information - General Readability and Layout </h4>
<p> <b>General Readability and Layout</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Layout-considerations-for-readability.jpg" alt="Layout considerations for readability">
<p> Layout considerations for readability </p>
<p> Users’ ability to find and follow instructions can be
  greatly affected by how information is organized and
  displayed. Key information can either pop out or can
  be lost in a sea of text and graphics. Likewise, these
  layouts can make information inaccessible to those
  using digital technologies such as OCR applications. </p>
<p> <b>Issue</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Too much information can be presented in a
    format that is difficult to follow. It can be difficult to
    understand what is meant to be read and in what
    order.</li>
  <li> Steps requiring multiple actions or tasks are
    challenging for all to follow. Multiple steps that
    take up different amounts of page ‘real estate’ are
    difficult to scan for low-vision users.</li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide a single, actionable task for each step.</li>
  <li> Break text into block paragraphs using bullet points
    when possible. As a best practice for all lay users,
    write short sentences at a 7th grade reading level.</li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Issue</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Text-layout-with-inconsistent-information-flow.jpg" alt="Text layout with inconsistent information flow">
<p> Text layout with inconsistent information flow </p>
<ul>
  <li>Blocks of text are sometimes presented in different
    layouts, some left to right and others top to bottom,
    making following along cumbersome.</li>
  <li> Lack of breaks in large blocks of text make the
    information difficult to digest and wide columns can
    make low-vision users dizzy. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Recommended-text-layout-and-information-flow.jpg" alt="Recommended text layout and in formation flow">
<p> Recommended text layout and in formation flow </p>
<ul>
  <li>Use a consistent layout. A columnar layout works
    best. Use the flow scheme shown above. Blocks are
    arranged in columns; columns are arranged left to
    right. Use narrow columns.</li>
  <li> Present document in landscape format if possible. </li>
  <li> Include a margin of at least three pixels between
    rows and columns. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Issue</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Numerous-warnings-embedded-in-copy.jpg" alt="Numerous warnings embedded in copy">
<p> Numerous warnings embedded in copy </p>
<p>Multiple warnings are presented inconsistently making
  it hard to locate them or allow the truly important
  warnings to attract the appropriate amount of attention. </p>
<p> <b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Targeted-warnings-visually-differentiated-from-plain-copy.jpg" alt="Targeted warnings, visually differentiated from plain copy">
<p> Targeted warnings, visually differentiated from plain copy </p>
<p>Essential warnings (e.g., those where use error is
  associated with the greatest risk of an invalid test
  result) should be communicated in a consistent
  manner (e.g., bold, red font). </p>
<h4> Instructions/Accessing Information - Physical Embodiment </h4>
<p> <b>Physical Embodiment</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Layout-considerations-for-readability.jpg" alt="Layout considerations for readability">
<p> Layout considerations for readability </p>
<p> Instructions can be provided in a number of ways: on a
  card, on paper, on a fold out, or in a booklet. The mode
  in which physical instructions are provided can impact
  readability and usability. </p>
<p> <b>Issue</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Information-split-along-paper-fold.jpg" alt="Information split along paper fold">
<p>Information split along paper fold</p>
<p>Large instruction panels with folds can result in text
  crossing over folds. Same-topic information may be
  split across front and back panels, resulting in
  reduced readability. </p>
<p> <b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Information-contained-within-folded-panels.jpg" alt="Information contained within folded panels">
<p>Information contained within folded panels</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure paper creases only appear in the margins of
    text columns. Text columns should be equal width.</li>
  <li> Including text column gutters on folds may make it
    easier to scan parts of a folded document for OCR. </li>
  <li> Place all information needed to run the test on one
    side of the paper or card. The other side can be
    used for supporting information. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Issue</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Instructions-that-require-full-unfolding.jpg" alt="Instructions that require full unfolding">
<p>Instructions that require full unfolding</p>
<ul>
  <li>It can be difficult to physically place instructions
    adjacent to the components due to size or material
    making them difficult to reference while using the
    test.</li>
  <li> Tests with fluid can result in spills which can
    deteriorate less robust instructional materials.</li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Instructions-that-can-be-unfolded-by-section.jpg" alt="Instructions that can be unfolded by section">
<p>Instructions that can be unfolded by section</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide instructions in a manner that they can be
    placed adjacent to a test kit on a table.</li>
  <li> Consider that lighter paper weights allow
    instructions to lay flat. Use materials which can
    withstand some amount of liquid spill. If coatings are
    used, limit reflectivity.</li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Issue</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Instructions-are-too-large-for-scanning.jpg" alt="Instructions are too large for scanning">
<p>Instructions are too large for scanning</p>
<p>Paper (or similar) documents may be provided in an
  incompatible format for assistive technologies. Pages
  or panels may be too large for flatbed scanners and
  smartphone OCR. Multiple panels without numbering
  make it difficult to navigate from page to page. </p>
<p> <b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Instructions-are-an-appropriate-size-for-scanning.jpg" alt="Instructions are an appropriate size for scanning">
<p>Instructions are an appropriate size for scanning</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide paper (or similar) documents in panels no
    larger than letter paper dimensions (8.5” x 11”).</li>
  <li> Use page numbers for multiple panels on the front
    and back. </li>
</ul>
<h4> Instructions/Accessing Information - Graphics, Images and Symbols </h4>
<p> <b>Graphics, Images and Symbols</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Arrows-show-user-interaction.jpg" alt="Arrows show user interaction with product">
<p>Arrows show user interaction with product</p>
<p>Graphics, images, and symbols can be an effective
  way for users to quickly perceive and understand

<p>Photo backgrounds distract from product</p>
<p>Photos contain extra, unnecessary information making
  them difficult for low-vision users to perceive. </p>
<p> <b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Line-drawings-improve-comprehension.jpg" alt="Line drawings improve comprehension">
<p>Line drawings improve comprehension</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use high-quality, high-contrast, thick line drawings
    with perspective instead of photos.</li>
  <li> Use varying line weights to distinguish detail and
    accent features (e.g., 0.5 pt – 1.5 pt for lines and 3
    pt – 4 pt for accent features). </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Issue</b> </p>
<img src="../images/2D-thin-line-and-low-contrast-drawings.jpg" alt="2D thin line and low-contrast drawings">
<p>2D thin line and low-contrast drawings</p>
<p>It can also be difficult to interpret 2D drawings,
  especially those with thin lines, low-contrast, or lower
  image quality or sharpness. </p>
<p> <b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<img src="../images/3D-drawing-with-appropriate-line-thickness.jpg" alt="3D drawing with appropriate line thickness">
<p>3D drawing with appropriate line thickness</p>
<p>Where possible, use 3D renderings with perspective
  and solid colors. </p>
<p> <b>Issue</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Images-without-context.jpg" alt="Images without context">
<p>Images without context</p>
<ul>
  <li>Images without context do not inform readers about
    relative component size.</li>
  <li> They force the reader to guess where and how
    components are to be utilized.</li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Images-with-context.jpg" alt="Images with context">
<p>Images with context</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make use of graphics that provide physical context
    for the reader (e.g., include hands, noses).</li>
  <li>Use only enough detail on features to clarify their
    purpose (e.g., a drawing of a head does not need to
    include hair).</li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Issue</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Non-standard-symbols.jpg" alt="Non-standard symbols">
<p>Non-standard symbols</p>
<p>Symbols are hard to understand if they are arbitrarily
  chosen or region-specific. Their meaning may not be
  obvious to the reader. </p>
<p> <b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Standard-symbols.jpg" alt="Standard symbols">
<p>Standard symbols</p>
<p>Use unambiguous and globally accepted symbols.
  Include a symbol key that is findable and near the
  symbol or include text labeling immediately adjacent
  to it. Follow the International Organization for
  Standardization (ISO) 15223 standard for symbols
  used on medical device packaging. </p>
<p> <b>Issue</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Drawings-without-realistic-detail.jpg" alt="Drawings without realistic detail">
<p>Drawings without realistic detail</p>
<p>Graphics that are not presented with details that match
  the actual components may cause confusion. </p>
<p> <b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Drawings-with-realistic-detail.jpg" alt="Drawings with realistic detail">
<p>Drawings with realistic detail</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure graphics/images match the actual
    appearance of the components (e.g., if a cap
    is gray, do not illustrate in white; if the cartridge
    has text or other markings on it, include these in
    graphics).</li>
  <li>Use grayscale sparingly and retain outlining of gray
    features.</li>
</ul>
<h4> Instructions/Accessing Information - Language </h4>
<p> <b>Language</b> </p>
<p>The vocabulary used in instructions is key to a user’s
  ability to understand what is required. Presenting
  information in plain, clear, concise language is critical
  to ensuring a user’s understanding of how to use the
  test kit. </p>
<p> <b>Issue</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Presenting critical information without text labels
    creates issues with OCR interpret-ability (e.g.,
    1-800-000-0000 without a ‘Customer Service
    Phone’ text label is read as a number string).</li>
  <li> Instructions sometimes refer to components and
    features inconsistently, which can make finding and
    following information difficult.</li>
  <li> Certain practices create unnecessary ambiguity,
    such as referring to components or features
    generally as “this” or “that”; and using abbreviations/
    acronyms</li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Text label critical information such as the product
    website, customer service phone number, and
    customer service email so they are recognized as
    such by OCR applications (e.g., Customer Service
    Phone Number: 1-800-000-0000).</li>
  <li>Use the same name for a component or feature
    throughout the instructions and labels on
    components or packaging.</li>
  <li>UProvide non-visual descriptive indicators when
    describing components or features.</li>
  <li>Avoid use of abbreviations or acronyms. If it is
    necessary, clearly define the abbreviation or
    acronym at first instance and use consistently
    thereafter.</li>

<h4> Instructions/Accessing Information - Modality </h4>
<p> <b>Modality</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Digital-modalities.jpg" alt="Digital modalities">
<p>Digital modalities</p>
<p>Digital instructions are a great way to convey
  information and are especially useful for no-vision,
  low-vision, and older users. However, merely providing
  digital instructions does not mean that they are actually
  accessible to each of those user groups.</p>
<p> <b>Issue</b> </p>
<p>Instructions are solely provided in print or accompanied
  by an image-only PDF making them inaccessible to
  users with no-vision, low-vision, dexterity challenges,
  or older users. </p>
<p> <b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<p>Offer instructions in alternate modalities conveying
  identical information such as: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Digital instructions compatible with a screen reader
    and conforming to Web Content Accessibility
    Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA and PDF/UA standards
    (e.g., HTML format on a web page) </li>
  <li> Large print and braille</li>
  <li> Audio format (MP3, etc.) </li>
  <li> Toll-free IVR telephone system</li>
  <li> Video with audio description, captions, and
    transcript</li>
</ul>
<h4> Instructions/Accessing Information - Assistive Technology Compatibility </h4>
<p> <b>Assistive Technology Compatibility</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Assistive-technologies.jpg" alt="Assistive technologies">
<p>Assistive technologies</p>
<p>Digital instructions should be provided on a website
  that conforms to WCAG 2.1 AA standard, and one that
  has been rigorously tested with assistive technology
  such as screen readers and voice dictation software.
  The website should be accessible via QR code and a
  plain text URL. Test-specific companion applications
  are another method for users to access digital
  instructions. Many people are familiar with the process
  of downloading an application.</p>
<p> <b>Issue</b> </p>
<p>Instructions are provided in a format that is not
  compatible with use on a smartphone or computer and/
  or that cannot be utilized by an accessible tool such as
  operating system (OS) accessibility features. </p>
<p> <b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li> Digital instructions should be on a web page
    (not just as a downloadable PDF) that applies
    responsive web design.</li>
  <li> Audit the web pages with assistive technology used
    by experienced digital accessibility professionals.</li>
  <li> Reference and implement best practices for making
    application content accessible:
    Web Accessibility
    Mobile Accessibility </li>
  <li> Ensure the QRG is available as a PDF that
    conforms to Section 508, WCAG 2.1 level AA, and
    PDF/Universal Accessibility (UA) standards.</li>
  <li> Ensure all images have meaningful, descriptive
    alternative (‘alt’) text, particularly when describing
    test components such that they can be discerned
    from one another non-visually.</li>
  <li> Ensure all form fields have accessible names/
    labels.</li>
  <li> Consider providing a Digital Accessible Information
    System (DAISY) format of the QRG with sections
    and subsections defined in the file (See also
    Physical Components - Instructions/Accessing
    Information <a href="#_above">above</a>).</li>
  <li> Provide a link or button on the web page that leads
    the user to a full digital version of the instructions
    and allow users to request a large-print or braille
    copy be mailed to them at no charge.</li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Issue</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Formatting-incompatible-with-screen-reader.jpg" alt="Formatting incompatible with screen reader">
<p>Formatting incompatible with screen reader</p>
<p>Not all digital instructions are compatible with screen
  readers. Key elements are often coded incorrectly
  or in a format that screen readers cannot detect,
  meaning content may be out of order, incomplete, or
  incomprehensible. Instructions may be provided in a
  format that is not compatible with use on a smartphone
  or tablet or that cannot be perceived by an accessible
  tool such as OS accessibility features. </p>
<p> <b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Formatting-compatible-with-screen-readers.jpg" alt="Formatting compatible with screen readers">
<p>Formatting compatible with screen readers</p>
<p>Ensure digital instructions are compatible with
  all commonly used screen readers. Confirm both
  computer and mobile screen reader compatibility of
  each and every screen element (e.g., images, fields,
  buttons). </p>
<h4> Instructions/Accessing Information - User Interface Features </h4>
<p> <b>User Interface (UI) Features</b> </p>
<img src="../images/User-interface-considerations.jpg" alt="User interface considerations">
<p>User interface considerations</p>
<p>The presence or absence of features in an application
  or web design can significantly impact usability and
  user satisfaction with the test. A small improvement in
  UI design can have a major impact on the entire user
  experience.</p>
<p> <b>Issue</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li> Some applications are limited to only one mode of
    orientation, which makes it difficult for low-vision
    users and those with phones that are mounted in a
    particular orientation to access information.</li>
  <li> Some devices require specific placement using
    visual cues only (e.g., camera alignment using
    only screen markers for reference) and it can be
    challenging or impossible to locate or correctly
    orient the component in the camera frame for no-
    vision and low-vision users.</li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li> Provide options to review content in both landscape
    and portrait orientations.</li>
  <li> If a device is required to be placed in a specific
    location in relation to a component (e.g., lining up
    one’s phone over a feature)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>1. Provide auditory/haptic device positioning and
      camera visibility feedback to user (e.g., “test
      identified” or “failed – move closer”; or “failed –
      increase brightness”). </li>
    <li>2. Consider implementing automated image
      correction.</li>

<p> <b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Important-information-presented-in-pop-up.jpg" alt="Important information presented in pop-up">
<p>Important information presented in pop-up</p>
<ul>
  <li> Provide pop-up messages for important content

    acknowledge the message.</li>
  <li> Errors, warnings, and success messages should not
    automatically disappear until the user acknowledges
    the message.</li>
</ul>
<h4> Instructions/Accessing Information - Operating System Compatibility </h4>
<p> <b>Operating System Compatibility</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Device-operating-systems.jpg" alt="Device operating systems">
<p>Device operating systems</p>
<p>The ability for content to be recognized and understood
  by computer, smartphone, and tablet OS and
  accessibility tools is vital for no-vision and low-vision
  user access to information about the test.</p>
<p> <b>Issue</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li> Instructions are provided in a format that is not
    compatible with computer, smartphone, or tablet OS
    and accessibility tools.</li>
  <li> Some features which provide feedback (e.g.,
    auditory and haptic) can compromise user’s privacy
    and others (e.g., bright mode) can be disruptive if
    users are working with them in the dark.</li>
  <li>Applications sometimes require users to enter data
    to sign in before providing access or allowing users
    to receive test results.</li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li> Ensure application recognizes and supports built-in
    device OS accessibility settings.</li>
  <li> Recognize and apply the user’s system-wide
    auditory/haptic feedback preferences and provide
    an in-application option to turn auditory/haptic
    feedback on or off.</li>
  <li>Enable dark mode support.</li>
  <li>If the application requires data entry for sign-in /
    results reporting:</li>
  <ul>
    <li> Enable auto fill; enable single sign-on (SSO)
      through Google, Facebook, etc.</li>
    <li> Clarify which data entry fields are required vs.
      optional.</li>
    <li> Save partial data (e.g., create a user profile) so
      user does not have to input data again for repeat
      testing.</li>
    <li> Ensure that all data entry fields are assigned
      screen readable labels.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h4> Instructions/Accessing Information - Audio Instructions </h4>
<p> <b>Audio Instructions via Website or Application</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Multiple-platforms-supporting-audio-content.jpg" alt="Multiple platforms supporting audio content">
<p>Multiple platforms supporting audio content</p>
<p>Audio may be the primary mode for some no-
  vision and low-vision users to receive instructions
  independently. Designing the audio content is critical
  to providing a comprehensive understanding of the
  product.</p>
<p> <b>Issue</b> </p>
<p>Audio instructions, which may be the preferred
  modality for some populations, are not always
  available.</p>
<p> <b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<p>Audio instructions should be available in easy-to-
  navigate formats and should utilize the text-only
  instructions as the script. Use of professional human
  voiceover is preferred to create the audio, but clear
  text-to-speech (TTS) engines may be used as an
  alternative. File formats include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> A downloadable podcast type file (M4A) with
    sections of the QRG included as timestamped
    chapters or episodes. Alternative open file types
    that support metadata and navigational features
    may be used.</li>
  <li> DAISY audio book file with sections of the QRG
    included as chapters.</li>
  <li>Downloadable MP3 files for each section as well as
    a master file of all sections together.</li>

<img src="../images/Interactive-Voice-Response-(IVR-)System.jpg" alt="Interactive Voice Response (IVR) System">
<p>Interactive Voice Response (IVR) System</p>
<p>IVR systems can be used to connect users to
  instructions through a phone call. This is particularly
  useful for users with lower familiarity with using web or
  mobile applications. Connecting users to instructions
  via telephone allows them to use a well-known,
  expected, and sometimes expedited instruction format.</p>
<p> <b>Issue</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Instructions-without-IVR-availability.jpg" alt="Instructions without IVR availability">
<p>Instructions without IVR availability</p>

<p> <b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Instructions-with-IVR-availability.jpg" alt="Instructions with IVR availability">
<p>Instructions with IVR availability</p>
<p>Provide audio instructions via IVR system capable of:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Navigating instructions in the same manner as the
    downloadable file types.</li>
  <li> Responding to inputs via button presses associated
    with actions (e.g., progress to next step, repeat
    current step, return to previous step, return to main
    menu, connect the user to a live agent as needed).</li>
</ul>
<h4> Instructions/Accessing Information - Video </h4>
<p> <b>Video</b> </p>
<img src="../images/Video-demonstration-of-test-procedure.jpg" alt="Video demonstration of test procedure">
<p>Video demonstration of test procedure</p>
<p>Videos can be an effective way to inform users about
  the product and how to use it. They can provide a
  dynamic demonstration to learners who prefer to
  process information visually and audibly.</p>
<p> <b>Issue</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li> Video is not always provided on websites or
    applications.</li>
  <li> Videos are not always accessible or as audibly
    descriptive as they are visually descriptive. Where
    provided, audio description may not cover all steps.</li>
  <li>Some videos do not provide the ability to pause,
    rewind, or forward in discrete chunks or increments,
    making it challenging to jump to the step a user is
    trying to review.</li>
  <li>Visuals with actors completing steps can be
    challenging for low-vision users to follow due to
    issues with lighting and contrast.</li>
  <li>Abbreviated versions of a longer video tempts
    users to skip the complete video and miss important
    steps.</li>
  <li>Users may miss some steps only described in
    audio.</li>
  <li>Users may not always want to refer to video,
    especially for repeated uses of a test</li>
  <li>Automatically looping videos can be distracting.</li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li> Make video tutorial instructions available via the
    product website.</li>
  <li> Confirm video player is accessible (see WCAG 2.1
    AA guidance).</li>
  <li>Provide the ability to control video playback
    including pause/play, rewind, forward, replay from
    the beginning, scroll through time or advance
    incrementally, and switch to full screen mode.</li>
  <li>Do not use visuals with actors completing steps,
    instead use high-contrast animations.</li>
  <li>Do not provide an abbreviated version of a longer
    video.</li>
  <li>UAudio and visual content should each be
    independently sufficient for a user to understand the
    video’s content</li>
  <li>Allow skipping the video after it has been viewed
    once.</li>
  <li>Avoid looping videos with no ability to pause.</li>
  <li>Include timestamps on the player for easy
    navigation to specific sections (e.g., getting started,
    workflow, interpreting results). Utilize common
    device OS system video controls.</li>
  <li>Label control buttons by function with large text and
    outline them with a two-pixel, lighter shade edge to
    suggest a bezel.</li>
  <li>Include multilingual closed-captions.</li>
  <li>Consider implementing a user profile recognition
    function to make video viewing required for the first
    test but optional for subsequent tests.</li>
</ul>
<h4> Instructions/Accessing Information - Language in Digital Formats </h4>
<p> <b>Language in Digital Formats</b> </p>
<p>The vocabulary used in instructions impacts a
  user’s ability to understand what is required of them
  throughout the test process. Presenting information
  in plain, clear, concise language is key to the user’s
  understanding of how to perform the test.</p>
<p> <b>Issue</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li> Digital instructions can provide language which is
    not descriptive enough for a no-vision user (e.g.,
    “Grasp the yellow swab package and tear open.”).
    Tactile descriptions are not consistently provided in
    digital instructions.</li>
  <li> There are also component references that can
    create ambiguity for no-vision users working with
    screen readers, such as referring to components as
    “this” or “that.”</li>
  <li>Instructions sometimes refer to components
    and features inconsistently, which makes finding
    information or following along difficult.</li>
  <li>Audible content is not always as fully descriptive as
    visual content. If provided, audio descriptions are
    sometimes not provided in detail for all steps.</li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Recommendation</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li> Provide concise, descriptive language of tactile
    differentiation for each component, especially
    for components which are highlighted visually in
    instructions (refer to pg. 28 for more information).</li>
  <li> Provide clear instructions to conduct the test by
    feel alone so that no-vision and low-vision users
    can identify, orient, and use the test components
    correctly. This should include:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>1. How to discern inner packages from one another
      (e.g., the two parts of a dropper in separate
      pouches)</li>
    <li>2. A clear non-visual physical description of each
      kit component including shape, size, and feel
      (versus color) (e.g., “Open the package that is a
      rectangle with a pull tab at the end.”)</li>
    <li>3. How components interact with each other</li>
    <li>4. Translating visual content with clear and non-
      physical audio descriptions</li>
