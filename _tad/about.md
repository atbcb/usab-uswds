These Technical Assistant (TA) Documents address design for specific subject areas and their sites, buildings, facilities, spaces, elements, and services to ensure accessibility for people with disabilities.

It is important to use the TA Documents produced by the Access Board in conjunction with complete copies of the [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/) and [Architectural Barriers Act (ABA)]({{ site.baseurl }}/aba/) Accessibility Standards.
These TA Documents explain, but **do not contain or reprint**, the text of the ADA and ABA Standards. 

These TA Documents review application of relevant existing ADA and ABA Accessibility Standards and non-mandatory recommendations and best practices to improve access to a site, building, facility, space, element, or service. In these TA Documents, the terms “must” or “required” refer to the applicable ADA, ABA, and Section 508 Standards with which entities must comply. The words “should” or “recommend(s)” refer to recommendations and best practices. Recommendations are not legally binding on any regulated entity but are provided as technical assistance to help regulated entities design sites, buildings, facilities, spaces, elements, and services that are accessible to and usable by people with disabilities.

TA Documents currently include:
* Design recommendations for accessible electric vehicle (EV) charging stations.
* Best Practices for the Design of Accessible COVID-19 Home Tests

Additional subject TA Documents will be posted as they become available. Sign up to the [Board’s news email](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USACCESS/subscriber/new?topic_id=USACCESS_1) list to receive updates on releases of other TA Documents.

These TA Documents are in the public domain.  Anyone is free to distribute and share the content or to disseminate copies.  Attribution is appreciated, but not required, and it is not neccessary to notify us of use, nor to request permission before use.
