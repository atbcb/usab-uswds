<h3>1. Background</h3>
<p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx®) initiative in 2020 to speed the innovation, development, commercialization, and implementation of COVID-19 testing technologies. The RADx Tech program, one arm of the initiative, was specifically designed to compress the customary technology development timeline from years down to just months. While NIH RADx Tech has increased testing capacity in the U.S., there is a continuing need to develop COVID-19 home tests that are accessible to all users, including populations that have no vision or low vision, have a reduced range of dexterity or motor skills, and are aging. </p>
<p>NIH RADx Tech began committing resources to increasing accessibility of COVID-19 home tests in early 2022. As a first step, the team consulted design groups and conducted research to locate existing accessible product design guidelines. Comprehensive guidelines for manufacturers around accessible design of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) products were nonexistent. Consequently, the team engaged advocacy groups with a deep knowledge of the experience and needs of target user populations. Importantly, these advocacy groups include members of the populations they serve.</p>
<p>NIH RADx Tech established a formal funding opportunity for accessible COVID-19 home tests. As part of this effort, RADx Tech engaged several different groups, including the Georgia Tech HomeLab, to conduct test accessibility evaluations; advocacy group partners to onboard accessibility design consultants from the target user populations; and academic centers specializing in accessibility to onboard additional subject matter experts (SMEs). SMEs provided individualized and detailed feedback on device usability and accessibility gaps, and collaborated with design firms to develop potential solutions. RADx Tech then worked with test kit manufacturers to bridge identified accessibility gaps on an accelerated timeline.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this best practices document is to capture and publicize learnings from the NIH RADx Tech accessibility program. What follows are detailed recommendations to assist manufacturers in the design of COVID-19 home tests that ensure greater accessibility for users that have no vision or low vision, have a reduced range of dexterity or motor skills, and are aging. </p>
<p>While the information presented emphasizes best practices for the design of COVID-19 home tests, many of these ergonomic and accessible design recommendations are transferable to home tests for other conditions and diseases. </p>
  <p>An abridged version of Best Practices for the Design of Accessible COVID-19 Home Tests, released in 2022, included a limited set of topics. This 2023 publication expands upon and refines the best practices recommendations contained therein and supersedes the 2022 release.</p>

<h3 id="design-considerations">4. Design Considerations </h3>
<p>Accessible product design/redesign requires more than incremental improvements to individual test kit components. To create a truly accessible at-home COVID-19 testing experience, the end-to-end workflow should be considered. A holistic review includes consideration of how various test kit components function together to create a seamless testing experience from kit acquisition through component disposal. Features incorporated to improve usability for one user group should improve usability for all. Universal design – “the design and composition of an environment [or product] so that it can be accessed, understood, and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, ability or disability” – is an appropriate and achievable goal. <a href="#one">[1]</a><span id="endnote1"></span></p>
<p>Below are several guiding principles for universal design of COVID-19 home tests:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Engage target end users early (see <a href="#assessing-usability">7. Assessing Usability</a>). </li>
  <li>Simplify workflow.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Fewer steps are easier to document, manage, and execute. </li>
    <li>Fewer components are easier to identify and handle and are less likely to be misplaced. </li>
    <li>Intuitive and familiar design elements and nomenclature reduce ambiguity. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Provide multi-modal test instructions.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide both physical and digital test instructions. </li>
    <li>Provide digital test instructions on an accessible webpage, as a downloadable document, and in a closed-captioned video tutorial with descriptive audio. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Eliminate the need for precision, where possible.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Steps that require precision (e.g., liquid transfer, counting drops, aligning parts with tight tolerances) may cause barriers to independent completion and increase potential for user error.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Avoid small components.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Larger components are easier to manipulate and see and are less likely to be misplaced.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Incorporate simultaneous nonvisual (e.g., audible, haptic) and visual cues. </li>
  <li>Illustrations should be simple, high-contrast, shaded line drawings with alt text.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="engaging-end-user-advocacy-groups">5. Engaging End User Advocacy Groups </h3>
<p>Human factors engineers are accustomed to being the end user advocates within the design development process. As such, they research users, learn about specific needs, and ensure these characteristics are included in the iterative and final designs. 
  In situations where the end user needs are difficult to understand, it can be challenging for human factors engineers to effectively advocate for an optimized design. It is therefore essential to engage directly with end users, both individually and through advocacy groups that include members of the populations they serve. </p>
<p>Advocacy groups are informed resources for: </p>
<ul>
  <li>expediting the learning process by providing access to a network of informed, experienced resources;</li>
  <li>confirming assumptions around product use and potential misuse; </li>
  <li>identifying user needs, preferences, and pitfalls in design; </li>
  <li>assessing designs for accessibility and usability; and</li>
  <li>arranging real-time design reviews and critiques.</li>
</ul>
<p>Manufacturers should plan to have ongoing relationships with end users. The more consistent their involvement, the more robust the final design will be. Designs should be assessed by end users representing a broad range of capabilities. Always plan to make design materials accessible to people with disabilities and circulate them prior to review. </p>
<hr />
<h3 id="regulatory-and-design-control">6. Regulatory and Design Control </h3>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for protecting public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, and radiation-emitting products; and by ensuring the safety of our nation’s food supply and cosmetics. <a href="#two">[2]</a><span id="endnote2"></span> Within FDA, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices and eliminating unnecessary exposure to radiation-emitting products. <a href="#three">[3]</a><span id="endnote3"></span></p>
<p>A medical device is broadly defined in Section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as “any instrument, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent that’s intended to treat, cure, prevent, mitigate, [or] diagnose disease in man”. <a href="#two">[2]</a>  Medical devices are classified based on risk: Class I devices demonstrate low risk, Class II devices demonstrate moderate risk, and Class III devices demonstrate high risk. <a href="#four">[4]</a><span id="endnote4"></span></p>
<p>A wealth of practical information on regulations pertaining to design, marketing, and distribution of medical devices is produced by the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) within CDRH. <a href="#five">[5]</a><span id="endnote5"></span> CDRH Learn is a useful educational tool that consists of learning modules describing many aspects of medical devices, covering both premarket and post-market topics. Modules are provided in various formats, including videos, audio recordings, and slide presentations. <a href="#six">[6]</a><span id="endnote6"></span></p>
<p><b>User Needs and Accessibility</b></p>
<p>Per 21 CFR Section 820.30, design control requirements apply to Class II and III medical devices, and a select group of Class I devices. These regulations require the manufacturer to base its design controls on the complexity and risks associated with its devices. <a href="#seven">[7]</a><span id="endnote7"></span></p>
<p>It includes new designs (premarket) and improvements or modifications to existing device designs (post-market). Design control begins after feasibility, or “Proof of Concept”, and continues throughout the product lifecycle. The first and most crucial step is identifying and documenting the user needs that will be used as the basis of product development during each phase. Defining user needs as they relate to accessibility is fundamental and ensures that the right product is designed. This is especially true for the design of over-the-counter (OTC) tests used outside of the clinical environment. These tests pose unique risks created by the interactions between the user, the use environment, and the device. </p>
<p>The general user population for these tests includes individuals that have no vision or low vision, have a reduced range of dexterity or motor skills, and are aging. </p>
<p>These groups must be considered when creating the user needs for an accessible OTC product. To confirm that such products are safe and effective in the hands of the intended user, validation testing must be performed in accordance with FDA recommendations to confirm the end user can use the product as intended (see <a href="#assessing-usability"> 7. Assessing Usability</a>). <a href="#eight">[8]</a><span id="endnote8"></span></p>
<p>These topics are further described in the seminal recommended practice document created by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). The stated purpose of this document, ANSI/AAMI HE75:2009/(R2018) Human Factors Engineering - Design of Medical Devices, is to provide a relevant source of human factors engineering (HFE) information, design criteria, and guidelines for medical devices. <a href="#nine">[9]</a><span id="endnote9"></span> The human factors design information and methodologies described may be used through all phases of design. Note that FDA recognizes most, but not all, of this standard. Specifically, FDA does not recognize Section 9 (Usability testing) as it conflicts with FDA guidance in “Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineering to Medical Devices.” <a href="#eight">[8]</a> Additional information is provided in the FDA presentation “How to Use Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions.”   <a href="#ten">[10]</a><span id="endnote10"></span></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="assessing-usability">7. Assessing Usability </h3>
<p>The best practices outlined in this document will aid manufacturers in creating an accessible and usable home test kit; however, understanding how well (or
  poorly) a design meets user needs requires design assessments. <a href="#eleven">[11]</a><span id="endnote11"></span></p>
<p>Early in the product development process, manufacturers should conduct a user feedback study with end users unfamiliar with the product, collecting feedback on low-fidelity prototypes. This is called a formative assessment. The objective of this type of study is to gather information about which features should or should not be carried forward as the design develops. Participants are often encouraged to describe concepts that may bridge gaps from the present design to a more optimal design.</p>
<p>As the design progresses, manufacturers should conduct an additional user feedback study with end users unfamiliar with the product, collecting feedback on high-fidelity prototypes that users employ to complete actual workflow steps. This is called a formative quantitative simulation-based assessment. Participants are encouraged to think aloud while moments of user delight or user frustration are identified. The objective of this type of study is to gain feedback on the design, including what type of information should be relayed in labeling and instructions. This study should be conducted in a simulated home environment, complete with
  anticipated distractions and hindrances (e.g., low lighting, background noise, clutter).</p>
<p>At the end of the development cycle, manufacturers should conduct a human factors validation study with end users unfamiliar with the product, collecting feedback on production-equivalent packaging, labeling, and devices, while users proceed through the entire workflow without interruption. This is called a summative assessment. This study should also be conducted in a simulated home environment. Refer to FDA guidance “Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineering to Medical Devices” for details. <a href="#eight">[8]</a></p>
<p>Any user errors or near misses should be noted, and after the study participant completes the full workflow, study staff should probe for reasons why the user error or near miss occurred to determine the root cause. </p>

<h4>Braille</h4>
<p>Braille is a tactile reading and writing system in which raised dots represent the letters of the alphabet, numbers, and symbols. <a href="#sixteen">[16]</a><span id="endnote16"></span> Braille serves as one approach to capturing and conveying the same level of detail provided in text content.  </p>
<p>Braille is an inherently physical medium traditionally produced using braille “printers” that emboss paper capable of retaining raised dots. Braille has a fixed minimum character size roughly comparable to 28-point font. One traditional print page of text typically transcribes to multiple braille pages, depending on the character count and formatting. Particularly dense, information-packed documents could easily transcribe into significantly longer paper braille documents, especially if they include complex content such as graphs, charts, or non-decorative images. It is desirable to make paper braille instructions available to customers upon request.<br />
  <br />
  Creating web-based, digitally accessible documents is a cost-effective method for manufacturers to provide additional access to braille. Braille displays enable users to access digital content through braille instead of audio only, so they can obtain the rich information embedded in text including capitalization, typographical emphasis, spacing, and punctuation. <a href="#sixteen">[16]</a>  Digital formats that can be readily converted to braille using assistive technology include:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>An accessible webpage with HTML content that is compatible with screen readers and braille devices. </li>
  <li>An accessible PDF document available for download. </li>
  <li>A braille-ready file (.brf) aimed at users who have braille devices but do not regularly make use of computers, smartphones, and/or the Internet. </li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Product labeling should adequately inform users of the instruction formats that are available and how to obtain them.</p>

        <li>When feasible, design the results status to be self-communicative and interpreted without the need for a key/legend (e.g., spell out ‘Control’ and ‘Test’ on cassette.</li>
        <li>Cassette labeling should all be in the same orientation.</li>
        <li>If cassette design includes a transparent shield over the results window, carefully consider how optics (e.g., refraction or reflection) might interfere with results interpretation.</li>
