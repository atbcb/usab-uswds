<h3 id="Background">1. Background</h3>
<p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx®) initiative in 2020 to speed the innovation, development, commercialization, and implementation of COVID-19 testing technologies. The RADx Tech program, one arm of the initiative, was specifically designed to compress the customary technology development timeline from years down to just months. While NIH RADx Tech has increased testing capacity in the U.S., there is a continuing need to develop COVID-19 home tests that are accessible to all users, including populations that have no vision or low vision, have a reduced range of dexterity or motor skills, and are aging. </p>
<p>NIH RADx Tech began committing resources to increasing accessibility of COVID-19 home tests in early 2022. As a first step, the team consulted design groups and conducted research to locate existing accessible product design guidelines. Comprehensive guidelines for manufacturers around accessible design of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) products were nonexistent. Consequently, the team engaged advocacy groups with a deep knowledge of the experience and needs of target user populations. Importantly, these advocacy groups include members of the populations they serve.</p>
<p>NIH RADx Tech established a formal funding opportunity for accessible COVID-19 home tests. As part of this effort, RADx Tech engaged several different groups, including the Georgia Tech HomeLab, to conduct test accessibility evaluations; advocacy group partners to onboard accessibility design consultants from the target user populations; and academic centers specializing in accessibility to onboard additional subject matter experts (SMEs). SMEs provided individualized and detailed feedback on device usability and accessibility gaps, and collaborated with design firms to develop potential solutions. RADx Tech then worked with test kit manufacturers to bridge identified accessibility gaps on an accelerated timeline.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this best practices document is to capture and publicize learnings from the NIH RADx Tech accessibility program. What follows are detailed recommendations to assist manufacturers in the design of COVID-19 home tests that ensure greater accessibility for users that have no vision or low vision, have a reduced range of dexterity or motor skills, and are aging. </p>
<p>While the information presented emphasizes best practices for the design of COVID-19 home tests, many of these ergonomic and accessible design recommendations are transferable to home tests for other conditions and diseases. 
  An abridged version of Best Practices for the Design of Accessible COVID-19 Home Tests, released in 2022, included a limited set of topics. This 2023 publication expands upon and refines the best practices recommendations contained therein and supersedes the 2022 release.</p>

<h3 id="design-considerations">4. Design Considerations </h3>
<p>Accessible product design/redesign requires more than incremental improvements to individual test kit components. To create a truly accessible at-home COVID-19 testing experience, the end-to-end workflow should be considered. A holistic review includes consideration of how various test kit components function together to create a seamless testing experience from kit acquisition through component disposal. Features incorporated to improve usability for one user group should improve usability for all. Universal design– “the design and composition of an environment [or product] so that it can be accessed, understood, and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, ability or disability” [1] –is an appropriate and achievable goal. </p>
<p>Below are several guiding principles for universal design of COVID-19 home tests:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Engage target end users early (see 7. Assessing Usability). </li>
  <li>Simplify workflow.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Fewer steps are easier to document, manage, and execute. </li>
    <li>Fewer components are easier to identify and handle and are less likely to be misplaced. </li>
    <li>Intuitive and familiar design elements and nomenclature reduce ambiguity. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Provide multi-modal test instructions.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide both physical and digital test instructions. </li>
    <li>Provide digital test instructions on an accessible webpage, as a downloadable document, and in a closed-captioned video tutorial with descriptive audio. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Eliminate the need for precision, where possible.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Steps that require precision (e.g., liquid transfer, counting drops, aligning parts with tight tolerances) may cause barriers to independent completion and increase potential for user error.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Avoid small components.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Larger components are easier to manipulate and see and are less likely to be misplaced.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Incorporate simultaneous nonvisual (e.g., audible, haptic) and visual cues. </li>
  <li>Illustrations should be simple, high-contrast, shaded line drawings with alt text.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="engaging-end-user-advocacy-groups">5. Engaging End User Advocacy Groups </h3>
<p>Human factors engineers are accustomed to being the end user advocates within the design development process. As such, they research users, learn about specific needs, and ensure these characteristics are included in the iterative and final designs. 
  In situations where the end user needs are difficult to understand, it can be challenging for human factors engineers to effectively advocate for an optimized design. It is therefore essential to engage directly with end users, both individually and through advocacy groups that include members of the populations they serve. </p>
<p>Advocacy groups are informed resources for: </p>
<ul>
  <li>expediting the learning process by providing access to a network of informed, experienced resources;</li>
  <li>confirming assumptions around product use and potential misuse; </li>
  <li> identifying user needs, preferences, and pitfalls in design; </li>
  <li>assessing designs for accessibility and usability; and arranging real-time design reviews and critiques. </li>
</ul>
<p>Manufacturers should plan to have ongoing relationships with end users. The more consistent their involvement, the more robust the final design will be. Designs should be assessed by end users representing a broad range of capabilities. Always plan to make design materials accessible to people with disabilities and circulate them prior to review. </p>
<hr />
<h3 id="regulatory-and-design-control">6. Regulatory and Design Control </h3>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) isbresponsible for protecting public health by ensuringbthe safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, and radiation-emitting products; and by ensuring the safety of our nation’s food supply and cosmetics. [2] Within FDA, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices and eliminating unnecessary exposure to radiation-emitting products. [3]</p>
<p>A medical device is broadly defined in Section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as “any instrument, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent that’s intended to treat, cure, prevent, mitigate, [or] diagnose disease in man”. [2] Medical devices are classified based on risk: Class I devices demonstrate low risk, Class II devices demonstrate moderate risk, and Class III devices demonstrate high risk. [4]</p>
<p>A wealth of practical information on regulations pertaining to design, marketing, and distribution of medical devices is produced by the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) within CDRH. CDRH Learn is a useful educational tool that consists of learning modules describing many aspects of medical devices, covering both premarket and post [5] market topics. Modules are provided in various formats, including videos, audio recordings, and slide presentations. [6]</p>
<p><b>User Needs and Accessibility</b></p>
<p>Per 21 CFR Section 820.30, design control requirements apply to Class II and III medical devices, and a select group of Class I devices. These regulations require the manufacturer to base its design controls on the complexity and risks associated with its devices. It includes new designs (premarket) and improvements or modifications to existing device designs (post-market). Design control begins after feasibility, or “Proof of Concept”, and continues throughout the product lifecycle. The first and most crucial step is identifying and documenting the user needs that will be used as the basis of product development during each phase. Defining user needs as they relate to accessibility is fundamental and ensures that the right product is designed. This is especially true for the design of over-the-counter (OTC) tests used outside of the clinical environment. These tests pose unique risks created by the interactions between the user, the use environment, and the device. </p>
<p>The general user population for these tests includes individuals that have no vision or low vision, have a reduced range of dexterity or motor skills, and are aging.</p>
<p>These groups must be considered when creating the user needs for an accessible OTC product. To confirm that such products are safe and effective in the hands of the intended user, validation testing must be performed in accordance with FDA recommendations to confirm the end user can use the product as intended (see 7. Assessing Usability). [8]</p>
<p>These topics are further described in the seminal recommended practice document created by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). The stated purpose of this document, ANSI/AAMI HE75:2009/(R2018) Human Factors Engineering - Design of Medical Devices, is to provide a relevant source of human factors engineering (HFE) information, design criteria, and guidelines for medical devices. The human factors design information and methodologies described may be used
  through all phases of design. Note that FDA recognizes most, but not all, of this standard. Specifically, FDA does not recognize Section 9 (Usability testing) as it conflicts with FDA guidance in “Applying Human [9] Factors and Usability Engineering to Medical Devices.” Additional information is provided in the FDA presentation “How to Use Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions.” [10]</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="assessing-usability">7. Assessing Usability </h3>
<p>The best practices outlined in this document will aid manufacturers in creating an accessible and usable home test kit; however, understanding how well (or
  poorly) a design meets user needs requires design assessments. [11]</p>
<p>Early in the product development process, manufacturers should conduct a user feedback study with end users unfamiliar with the product, collecting feedback on low-fidelity prototypes. This is called a formative assessment. The objective of this type of study is to gather information about which features should or should not be carried forward as the design develops. Participants are often encouraged to describe concepts that may bridge gaps from the present design to a more optimal design.</p>
<p>As the design progresses, manufacturers should conduct an additional user feedback study with end users unfamiliar with the product, collecting feedback on high-fidelity prototypes that users employ to complete actual workflow steps. This is called a formative quantitative simulation-based assessment. Participants are encouraged to think aloud while moments of user delight or user frustration are identified. The objective of this type of study is to gain feedback on the design, including what type of information should be relayed in labeling and instructions. This study should be conducted in a simulated home environment, complete with
  anticipated distractions and hindrances (e.g., low lighting, background noise, clutter).</p>
<p>At the end of the development cycle, manufacturers should conduct a human factors validation study with end users unfamiliar with the product, collecting feedback on production-equivalent packaging, labeling, and devices, while users proceed through the entire workflow without interruption. This is called a summative assessment. This study should also be conducted in a simulated home environment. Refer to FDA guidance “Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineering to Medical Devices” for details. [8]</p>
<p>Any user errors or near misses should be noted, and after the study participant completes the full workflow, study staff should probe for reasons why the user error or near miss occurred to determine the root cause. </p>

      </ul>
      <h4>Plain Language </h4>
      <p>Plain language is a process for developing a communication (such as a printed document, webpage, or mobile application screen) that allows intended users to “find what they need, understand what they find, and use what they find to meet their needs”. [13, 14]</p>
      <p>Plain language is the process of developing user-appropriate information. It includes purpose, structure, expression, design, and evaluation.</p>
      <p><b>Purpose:</b> identify and describe the target users and the communication goals. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Develop clear information goals. </li>
        <li>Select document content with the target users in mind. </li>
        <li>Align content structure and design to target users’ needs, skills, and interests </li>
        <li>Use target user information, such as reading level, experience, and style preferences, when developing content. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Structure:</b> group and present content with a clear rationale to guide the user. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Organize the document with ease of access in mind. </li>
        <li>Use familiar structures to make document navigation logical and relatable. </li>
        <li>Create balance in information delivery: not too lengthy, in order to maintain attention, and not too short, in order to provide sufficient context. </li>
        <li>Create document flow by grouping related content and using descriptive headers. </li>
        <li>Divide document sections clearly and consistently. </li>
        <li>Limit header levels to three or fewer. </li>
        <li>Present sequential items in a numbered list rather than a bulleted list. </li>
        <li>Use parallel structures for equivalent content. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Expression:</b> select words, sentence structure, and overall organization for logic and empathy to promote comprehension and engagement. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use terminology specific to the end user.</li>
        <li>Provide the lay user with an explanation of unfamiliar or technical terms. </li>
        <li>Incorporate descriptive language where possible (see 8.3 Language • Descriptive Language). </li>
        <li>Mix sentence length, with an average of 12-15 words per sentence. </li>
        <li>Lead paragraphs with key information. </li>
        <li>Create coherence by grouping related ideas, with transition words between sections when appropriate.</li>
        <li>Use a bias-free conversational tone, focusing on positive outcomes and desired behaviors. </li>
        <li>Use warnings to convey potential negative outcomes </li>
        <li>Match hyperlinked text to the landing webpage titles. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Design:</b> apply information design to enhance legibility, readability, and comprehension. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure document design elements support the message as well as user comprehension.</li>
        <li>Use typography to support legibility (see 8.1 legibility). </li>
        <li>Use layout to support readability. </li>
        <li>Use whitespace to highlight information organization. </li>
        <li>Use clear and meaningful illustrations to support comprehension.</li>
        <li>Use illustrations of desired behaviors and results, when possible.</li>
        <li>Omit unnecessary elements that create distraction. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Evaluation:</b> develop and test wording, structure, and design with end users. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Elicit input from target users to determine needs, preferences, usability, and satisfaction before, during, and after development of a document.</li>
        <li>(See and 5. Engaging End User Advocacy Groups 7. Assessing Usability). </li>
        <li>Develop information with input from target users. </li>
        <li>Select valid methods for measuring understanding and actionability of information.</li>
        <li>Measure information clarity, accuracy, and usefulness with the target users.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Ask target users if it is clear who the information is for and what the purpose is.</li>
          <li>Ask target users to paraphrase key concepts and show how they would find information in the document.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Compare before and after versions of the information to confirm plain language improvement.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h4>Descriptive Language </h4>
      <p>Language should be descriptive and provide non visual points of reference and instruction for better end user comprehension. In general, word count should be minimized while still providing effective descriptions. Ideally, descriptive language should be included in body text of test instructions, but additional supporting information may be provided via alt text or ‘More Info’ redirects.</p>

      <h5>Issue</h5>
      <ul>
        <li> Certain practices create unnecessary ambiguity, such as referring to components or features generally as “this” or “that” and using abbreviations/ acronyms. </li>

      <h5>Recommendation</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid using pronouns. </li>
        <li>Avoid using abbreviations or acronyms. If necessary, clearly define the abbreviation or acronym at first instance and use consistently thereafter. </li>
        <li>Use the same name for a component or feature throughout the test instructions and labels on components or packaging. </li>
        <li>Components should be described with both tactile and visual references. Terminology used should focus on differentiating components by feel, such as through shape, texture, material, or weight. Example descriptors: </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Shape: rectangular, cylindrical, long, thin, wide, flat, narrow, tall </li>
          <li>Texture: smooth, rough, soft, hard, raised </li>

      <ul>
        <li>Color should be used to refer to easily distinguishable areas, and reference to color should be accompanied by a nonvisual descriptor (e.g., ribbed red dropper cap, rectangular silver pouch). </li>

    </div>
    <div class="tablet:grid-col">
      <h5>Recommendation</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with a brief description of how the feature will feel and follow with details of location progressing from broad to specific to yield one unique location. Conclude with a secondary visual descriptor. </li>
        <ul>
          <li> Example: “The notch is a small slit in the edge of the flat, foil pouch on the long side near one end. It is marked with a black arrow.” </li>
          <li> Description composition: [feature name = notch] [feature tactile reference = small slit in edge] [highest level location reference = flat, foil pouch] [increasingly specific location = long side, near one end] [secondary visual descriptor = black arrow]. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>For results interpretation, describe the relative location of the result indicators.</li>
        <ul>
          <li> Example: “The results window is positioned closest to the rectangular end of the cassette.

<h4>Alternative Text </h4>
<p>Alternative (alt) text is text included in webpage HTML code or in a digital file tag structure that describes non-text media such as graphs, charts, and non decorative images. It provides equal access for those viewing content with a braille display or screen reader.</p>
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="tablet:grid-col">
      <h5>Issue</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Alt text may inadequately describe the content of an illustration. </li>
        <li>Alt text may inadequately convey information in visuals. </li>
        <li>Alt text length varies. </li>
        <li>Alt text may be overly informal. </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="tablet:grid-col">
      <h5>Recommendation</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Alt text should build on the copy, translating visual content and providing supporting detail without being redundant. Together, alt text and instructional copy should enable a user to understand and complete the test workflow without visual references. </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Example: “an illustration of a swab breaking in half with the tip in a tube” would be better written as “with the swab tip in the tube, the swab can be broken in half at a notch in the middle of the handle”. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Reiterate critical warnings provided in illustrations where the critical warning text is not included in the copy and digital read order. </li>
        <li>Generally, alt text should be kept to one to two sentences, though complex visuals may require longer alt text. </li>
        <li>If alt text is lengthy, consider incorporating it as part of the body text of test instructions instead. </li>
        <li>Maintain correct grammar and punctuation in alt text. </li>
      </ul>

<h4>Braille</h4>
<p>Braille is a tactile reading and writing system in which raised dots represent the letters of the alphabet, [16]
  numbers, and symbols. Braille serves as one approach to capturing and conveying the same level of detail provided in text content. </p>
<p>Braille is an inherently physical medium traditionally produced using braille “printers” that emboss paper capable of retaining raised dots. Braille has a fixed minimum character size roughly comparable to 28-point font. One traditional print page of text typically transcribes to multiple braille pages, depending on the character count and formatting. Particularly dense, information-packed documents could easily transcribe into significantly longer paper braille documents, especially if they include complex content such as graphs, charts, or non-decorative images. It is desirable to make paper braille instructions available to customers upon request. <br>
  <br>
  Creating web-based, digitally accessible documents is a cost-effective method for manufacturers to provide additional access to braille. Braille displays enable users to access digital content through braille instead of audio only, so they can obtain the rich information embedded in text including capitalization, typographical emphasis, spacing, and punctuation. Digital [16] formats that can be readily converted to braille using assistive technology include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>An accessible webpage with HTML content that is compatible with screen readers and braille devices. </li>
  <li>An accessible PDF document available for download. </li>
  <li>A braille-ready file (.brf) aimed at users who have braille devices but do not regularly make use of computers, smartphones, and/or the Internet. </li>
</ul>
<p>Note: product labeling should adequately inform users of the instruction formats that are available and how to obtain them.</p>

      <p>Paper (or similar) documents may be provided in an incompatible format for assistive technology. Pages or panels may be too large for flatbed scanners and smartphone OCR. Multiple panels without numbering make it difficult to navigate from page to page. </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Provide paper (or similar) documents in panels no larger than 8.5 x 11 inches (216 x 279 mm) U.S. letter size to facilitate flatbed scanning. </li>
        <li>Use page numbers for multiple panels on the front and back.</li>
