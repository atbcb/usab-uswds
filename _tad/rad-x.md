### Introduction

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx®) initiative to speed innovation, development, commercialization, and implementation of COVID-19 testing technologies. The RADx Tech program, one arm of the initiative, was specifically designed to compress the customary technology development timeline from years down to just months. While these programs have increased testing capacity in the U.S. by billions, there is a continuing need to develop at-home COVID-19 tests that are accessible to all users including populations that have no vision or low vision, a reduced range of dexterity or motor skills, and that are aging.

Within RADx Tech, the RADx Deployment Core has focused on increasing accessibility of at-home COVID-19 tests. As first steps, research was conducted to locate pre-existing accessible product design guidelines and engineering design groups were consulted. One of the immediate and surprising insights to come from these efforts was the lack of comprehensive in vitro diagnostic (IVD) guidelines or standards for accessible design of IVD products for manufacturers and engineers. Advocacy groups and foundations that have a deep knowledge of the experience and needs of people with these types of challenges were engaged.

Due to the lack of fully accessible at-home COVID-19 tests, a research funding program was created with the purpose of developing more accessible tests.
Through this effort, members of advocacy groups continue to be engaged to help provide feedback on device usability and troubleshoot design challenges for these populations. RADx Tech experts are actively working with manufacturers to address device design, packaging, and modes of instruction, among other challenges.

Through knowledge garnered from all the above actions, a comprehensive, practical and useful set of Best Practice Recommendations was created to help fill a critical need in the design community. It is intended that this document will be used primarily by manufacturers for designing more accessible IVDs. While the goal of the document is to provide recommendations for making an at-home diagnostic kit accessible to aging populations and/or users with visual/motor disabilities, many of the recommendations will improve the overall usability and will likely result in universal access to the test kit.

When this work began, it was recognized that there was a need to provide information to the manufacturing and engineering communities as soon as possible. This document is an abridged version of Best Practice Recommendations, and covers topics prioritized for early release. A more complete version is expected to be posted in the first half of 2023.

### Glossary

Cartridge
: Device where a sample is added, processed, and a result is communicated visually or by a test reader.

Dropper
: Device usually intended to contain the buffer fluid into which the sample is introduced and transferred to the cartridge. May be integrated into a fluid vial.

Fluid Vial
: Container of fluid intended to be dispensed into another container (e.g., dropper).

Haptic Feedback
: Feedback that creates a touch experience for the user through application of force or motion. Tends to be related to dynamic physical features (e.g., phone vibration) (See also tactile feedback).

Lateral Flow Assay (LFA)
: (Also referred to as a lateral flow device, a rapid test, or a lateral flow immunochromatographic assay) A device intended to detect the presence of a target substance in a liquid sample without the need for specialized and costly equipment.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
: Software that converts non-editable document formats such as PDFs, images or paper documents into machinereadable formats that are editable and searchable.

Quick Response (QR) Code
: A type of matrix barcode that can be read easily by a digital device, which stores information as a series of pixels in a square-shaped grid.

Quick Reference Guide (QRG)
: (Also referred to as Quick Reference Information (QRI)) A short version of the test instructions. It is intended for untrained operators and contains the step-by-step instructions needed to perform the test with a negligible likelihood of erroneous results.

Responsive Web Design
: (Also referred to as responsive design) An approach to web design that aims to make web pages render on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes from minimum to maximum display size to ensure usability and satisfaction.

Screen Reader
: A software program or an application that enables no-vision or low-vision users to convert text displayed on a computer screen, tablet or phone into synthesized speech or to a refreshable braille display. A screen reader is the interface between the computer’s software and the user. It enables users to perform any operation on a computer (e.g., JAWS and NVDA on Windows; VoiceOver on macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS; and TalkBack on Android phones, tablets, and kiosks).

Swab
: The sample collection device with one part intended to be held in the hand and another part placed into the nostril.

Tactile Feedback
: Feedback that is perceptible by touch. Tends to be related to static physical features (e.g., a button that is higher than the device surface) (See also haptic feedback).

Test Reader
: Device which accepts cartridges and/or analyzes a sample and provides a test result.

Tube Holder
: Device which holds a fluid vial in an upright position.

      <h4>General Readability and Layout</h4>
      <p>Users' ability to find and follow instructions can be greatly affected by how information is organized and displayed. Key information can either pop out or can be lost in a sea of text and graphics. Likewise, these layouts can make information inaccessible to those using digital technologies such as OCR applications.</p>

#### Language

The vocabulary used in instructions is key to a user's ability to understand what is required. Presenting information in plain, clear, concise language is critical to ensuring a user's understanding of how to use the test kit.

  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="tablet:grid-col">
      <h6>Issue</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Presenting critical information without text labels creates issues with OCR interpret-ability (e.g., 1-800-000-0000 without a 'Customer Service Phone' text label is read as a number string).</li>
        <li>Instructions sometimes refer to components and features inconsistently, which can make finding and following information difficult.</li>
        <li>Certain practices create unnecessary ambiguity, such as referring to components or features generally as "this" or "that"; and using abbreviations/ acronyms.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="tablet:grid-col">
      <h6>Recommendation</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Text label critical information such as the product website, customer service phone number, and customer service email so they are recognized as such by OCR applications (e.g., Customer Service Phone Number: 1-800-000-0000).</li>
        <li>Use the same name for a component or feature throughout the instructions and labels on components or packaging.</li>
        <li>Provide non-visual descriptive indicators when describing components or features.</li>
        <li>Avoid use of abbreviations or acronyms. If it is necessary, clearly define the abbreviation or acronym at first instance and use consistently thereafter.</li>

#### Language in Digital Formats

The vocabulary used in instructions impacts a user's ability to understand what is required of them throughout the test process. Presenting information in plain, clear, concise language is key to the user's understanding of how to perform the test.

      <ul>
        <li>Digital instructions can provide language which is not descriptive enough for a no-vision user (e.g., "Grasp the yellow swab package and tear open."). Tactile descriptions are not consistently provided in digital instructions.</li>
        <li>There are also component references that can create ambiguity for no-vision users working with screen readers, such as referring to components as "this" or "that."</li>
        <li>Audible content is not always as fully descriptive as visual content. If provided, audio descriptions are sometimes not provided in detail for all steps.</li>

        <li>Provide clear instructions to conduct the test by feel alone so that no-vision and low-vision users can identify, orient, and use the test components correctly. This should include:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>1. How to discern inner packages from one another (e.g., the two parts of a dropper in separate pouches)</li>
          <li>2. A clear non-visual physical description of each kit component including shape, size, and feel (versus color) (e.g., "Open the package that is a rectangle with a pull tab at the end.")</li>
          <li>3. How components interact with each other</li>

      <h4>Connecting/Bluetooth Pairing</h4>
      <p>Some tests may require Bluetooth pairing (connecting a smartphone and another device) to read and communicate results. Pairing devices involves having two components in proximity to each other, initiating a pairing sequence, receiving feedback when pairing has been completed successfully (or not), and understanding what that feedback signifies.</p>
