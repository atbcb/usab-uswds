Standards issued under the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) apply to
facilities designed, built, altered, or leased with federal funds. Four
agencies establish the ABA Standards according to guidelines issued by
the Access Board:

-   Department of Defense (DOD)
-   Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
-   General Services Administration (GSA)
-   U.S. Postal Service (USPS).

This guide explains requirements in the current editions of the [ABA
Standards](../aba-standards.html) issued by DOD, GSA, and USPS, which
are substantively the same as each is closely based on the Board's
updated ABA guidelines (2004). (HUD has yet to update its ABA Standards
and continues to apply the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards to
facilities under its jurisdiction.)

It is important to use this guide along with a complete copy of the ABA
Standards as it explains, but does not contain or reprint, the text of
the ABA Standards. In addition to explaining the requirements of the ABA
Standards, this guide also provides clearly labeled recommendations for
best practices that exceed the minimum requirements and are thus
optional to follow.
