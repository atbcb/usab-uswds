### Tactile Signs \[§703.2 – §703.4, §703.6] 

Tactile signs must have raised characters that are repeated in Grade 2 braille. In addition, they 
are subject to requirements for non-glare finish and color contrast for visual accessibility. 

Other information provided in addition to permanent room or space labels is not required to be 
raised or brailled but must meet visual criteria if informational or directional.  Some information 
on such signs may be exempt, such as occupant names.

caption:  The required location of tactile signs is relatively 
uniform (i.e., beside or, where permitted, on doors) 
to make them easier to locate without vision.  The 
height is limited to a specific range (48 inches – 60 
inches) to facilitate reading by touch.

### Required Compliance

[[§F241]({{ site.baseurl }}/aba/#aba-f241)]

Saunas and steam rooms, where provided, must be accessible. Where two or more saunas or steam rooms are clustered at a single location (i.e., next to, or close to, one another), at least 5%, but no less than one of each type, must comply. Examples of different types include, but are not limited to, those designated by gender or features such as wet or dry heat and temperature capacity.

#### Saunas and Steam Rooms

[[§612]({{ site.baseurl }}/aba/#aba-612)]

Requirements for saunas and steam rooms address doors, wheelchair turning space, benches, and controls and other operable parts.

### Turning Space

[[§612.3]({{ site.baseurl }}/aba/#aba-612_3), [§304]({{ site.baseurl }}/aba/#aba-304)]

Wheelchair turning space is required in accessible saunas and steam rooms. This turning space must be a 60\" diameter circle or T-shaped. Readily removable benches may obstruct the turning space, but it is advisable that they be placed outside the turning space.

### Benches

[[§612.2]({{ site.baseurl }}/aba/#aba-612_2), [§903]({{ site.baseurl }}/aba/#aba-903)]

Seating in saunas and steam rooms must have at least one compliant bench when seating is provided. The accessible bench must be fixed or built in. Unobstructed clear floor space 30\" minimum by 48\" minimum is required at the end of the bench and parallel to the short side of the bench. Doors cannot swing into this space. Other readily removable benches may obstruct the clear floor space of the accessible bench, but it is advisable that they be placed outside this space.

<figure class="center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter6/saunas/2.jpg" alt="Elevated perspective view of fixed bench inside a sauna.  A highlighted clear floor space is adjacent to the bench and labeled dimensions of 30 inches deep minimum and 48 inches wide minimum." class="center">
  <figcaption style="text-align:center; font-size:smaller; font-style:oblique;">
    Clear floor space is required at the end of the bench and parallel to the short axis of the bench.

</figure>

The seat of the bench must be 42\" long minimum, 20\" to 24\" deep, and 17\" to 19\" high. Walls may be used as back support for the bench. Benches not fixed to the wall must provide back support that is 42\" long minimum, extends from a point 2\" maximum above the seat surface to a point 18\" minimum above the seat surface, and is 2½\" maximum from the rear edge of the seat measured horizontally (§903.4).

    Dimensions show the floor or ground to the top of the seating surface is 17\" to 19\" the leading edge of the seat to the back support is 20\" to 24\" and the top of the back support to surface of the seating slats is 18 inches minimum.  
    The inset image shows dimensions of 2\" maximum from the top surface of seating slat to the bottom edge of back support slat; and a 2½\" maximum from rear edge of seating slat to front of back support slat.

The structural strength of benches and back support must withstand a vertical or horizontal force of 250 lbs. In wet locations, the surface of the seat must be slip resistant and not accumulate water.

### Doors

[[§404]({{ site.baseurl }}/aba/#aba-404)]

Doors to saunas and steam rooms must meet all applicable requirements, including those for clear width (32\" minimum), maneuvering clearance, thresholds, hardware, opening force (5 pounds of force maximum), closing speed, and smooth surfacing at the bottom of the push side. Doors that have a window or glazed panel that permits viewing shall have the bottom edge of the panel no higher than 43\" above the floor so that it can be used from a seated position. If the bottom edge of a window or glazed panel is higher than 66\" above the floor, it is not intended for viewing.

If thresholds are provided at doorways, they cannot exceed ½\" high. The edge must be beveled 1:2 maximum above a height of ¼\". Where changes in level are higher than ½\" because of pre-fabricated unit configurations, compliant ramps and landings must be provided.

If entrance landings and ramps are provided to doors, they must accommodate door maneuvering clearances. Maneuvering clearances for wheelchairs apply to both sides of the entry door. Doors cannot swing into the clear floor space required at benches.

For more information on door requirements, see the [Entrances, Doors, and Gates Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/aba/guides/chapter-4-entrances-doors-and-gates/).

{% include recommendation.html text="Some users may leave their mobility device outside the sauna or steam room. Where possible, space should be available outside saunas or steam rooms and near the entrance (but outside the door maneuvering clearance) for mobility devices." %}
