This guide provides an introduction to the scoping requirements of the [ABA Standards]({{ site.baseurl }}/aba/) and is intended to be used with a complete copy of the ABA Standards since it does not contain or address the full content of the Standards. It is important that users familiarize themselves with the specific scoping requirements contained in the ABA Standards.


### Scoping Requirements

![Diagram – circle labeled “Chapter 2” pointing circles representing Chapters 3 - 10]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter2-aba/nc2.jpg){: .float-right .img-right}

Requirements in Chapter F2 indicate which elements and spaces must be accessible on a site or in a facility (the scope of coverage). These “scoping” requirements apply technical provisions in Chapters 3 – 10 to those covered elements and spaces provided on a site.

Applicable building codes, design practices, and other factors determine the elements and spaces required for a site, including parking, means of egress, and plumbing fixtures. The ABA Standards, on the other hand, specify the elements and spaces provided that must be accessible.

### Application

[[§F201]({{ site.baseurl }}/aba/ch02/#F201-Application)]

The ABA Standards apply to the various types of federally funded facilities subject to the ABA, from simple structures to complex, multi-facility sites. Requirements in the standards apply to both exterior and interior spaces and elements provided on a site, usually without distinction. Provisions for parking, for example, apply equally to exterior lots and to parking garages. The standards cover permanent facilities and temporary facilities (other than those used in construction), such as reviewing stands, stages, portable toilets, and temporary classrooms.

In new construction, all areas must be fully accessible, including multiple spaces of the same type, unless otherwise specified. Areas not required to be fully accessible include:

*   certain limited-use or raised spaces that are exempt (§F203)
*   spaces covered by scoping provisions that require only a specified portion of the total number to comply, such as dressing rooms and patient bedrooms (various provisions in Chapter 2)

### General Exceptions

[[§F203]({{ site.baseurl }}/aba/ch02/#F203-General-Exceptions)]

These structures and spaces are fully exempt from the standards and are not required to be accessible or on an accessible route:

#### General Elements

Most scoping provisions apply to both interior and exterior elements where provided throughout facilities and sites (and are not limited to those in corridors as shown here).

 ![Figure of corridor with a door, elevator, light sconce (protruding object), outlet and fire extinguisher cabinet (operable parts).  Figure notes:  Accessible Routes (§F206) and Doors (§F206.5) An accessible route must connect all accessible spaces and elements in a facility, and doors on accessible routes must comply Protruding Objects (§F204) Objects on all circulation paths (not just accessible routes) must be installed so that they do not pose hazards to people with vision impairments. Operable Parts (§F205) Controls, outlets, receptacles, and other operable parts are covered (excluding those used only by maintenance personnel or serving a dedicated use)..  Elevators (§F206.6)  Vertical access between stories is required in multi-story facilities with few exceptions. Stairways (§F210) All stairs that are part of a required means of egress must comply. Windows (§F229) If windows are provided in accessible spaces for operation by occupants, at least 1 must comply.  Each window that is required to be operable by a local code or authority also must comply.  These requirements do not apply to residential facilities.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter2-aba/nc5.jpg){: .img-large}

#### Communication Elements

 ![Figure of corridor with overhead sign (“East Wing Rooms 300 – 350”), sign at door, fire alarm, and pay telephone.

Signs (§F216) Directional and informational signs, where provided, must meet requirements for visual access, and signs identifying permanent spaces, room numbers/ names, floor levels, and exits must also have raised characters and braille. The International Symbol of Accessibility is used to identify accessible entrances, restrooms, and bathing facilities (unless all are accessible), as well as to label accessible parking spaces, and check-out aisles.  Symbols are also specified for signs indicating assistive listening systems and TTYs.   Telephones (§F217) All public telephones must have volume control and wheelchair access is required to at least 1 public phone of each type (e.g., pay, closed circuit, courtesy, etc.) provided on a floor/level or exterior site (or at each bank if more than 1 bank is provided on a floor). TTYs are required based on the number of pay telephones provided. Assistive Listening Systems (§F219) Assistive listening systems for people who are hard of hearing are required in all assembly areas equipped with audio amplification and all courtrooms.  Two-way Communication Systems (§F230) Two-way communication systems provided to gain admittance to buildings must be accessible and have audible and visual signals.

If multi-user toilet or bathing facilities are provided, accessible unisex facilities cannot substitute for access to multi-user rooms (except in certain alterations where compliance is technically infeasible).     Kitchens, Kitchenettes, and Sinks (§F212) Kitchens, kitchenettes, and sinks must comply.  Access is required to at least 5% of each type of sink in accessible rooms or spaces but no fewer than 1 (except those in work areas used only by employees for work purposes).

#### Specific Spaces and Occupancies

The ABA Standards include scoping requirements specific to certain types of spaces and facilities that apply based on the intended use and design. Spaces with multiple uses must meet all applicable requirements for each use. Scoping provisions for specific spaces and occupancies address:

### Common Questions

![question mark]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}ques.jpg){: .float-right .thumbnail}

#### Are all public use and common use areas required to be accessible?

All areas of facilities are required to be fully accessible in new construction except those that are specifically exempt (e.g., certain types of limited use or raised spaces) or that are covered by provisions that require only a specified portion to comply (e.g., transient lodging guest rooms and patient bedrooms). All other rooms and spaces, including multiple ones of the same type, such as patient exam rooms, classrooms, and courtrooms, are required to be accessible.

#### Are employee work areas required to be accessible?

Yes, the ABA Standards apply fully to employee work areas (unlike the ADA standards which have more limited requirements for such spaces). Elements used by employees in work areas, including work surfaces, must comply. Spaces used by employees for purposes other than work, including restrooms, break rooms, locker rooms, lounges, and parking are also fully covered.

#### Can access be provided after construction based on need?

Access required by the ABA Standards must be put in place and ready for use as part of construction. This is required in all but a few specified instances, such as:

- Toilet and bathrooms in residential dwelling units or accessed through an individual’s private office for his or her exclusive use are not required to be built with certain specifically enumerated access features, such as grab bars and lavatory clearances, if they are built according to criteria that will facilitate later installation or adaptation, such as reinforcement for grab bars and removable vanity cabinets.
- Vertical access to work stations in courtrooms, such as judges’ benches, can be provided after construction if space and other requirements are met to ease later installation of necessary ramps or lifts.
