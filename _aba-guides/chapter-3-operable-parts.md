This guide explains requirements in the [ABA Standards](/guidelines-and-standards/buildings-and-sites/about-the-aba-standards/aba-standards) for operable parts.

### Operable Parts Covered

[[§F205](/guidelines-and-standards/buildings-and-sites/about-the-aba-standards/aba-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements#F205%20Operable%20Parts)]

Compliance is required for operable parts located in accessible spaces and along accessible routes. Operable parts include light switches, electrical and communication receptacles, thermostats, alarm pulls, automatic door controls, and other elements used by facility occupants.

#### Examples of Operable Parts

![Examples of operable parts (fire extinguisher cabinet, drinking fountain, fire alarm pull, and electrical outlet.  Notes:  Compliance is required for the operable portions of fixed elements, such as cabinet hardware, but not for inoperable portions or to non-fixed components, such as fire extinguishers; Electrical outlets, alarm pulls, and many other types of receptacles and controls are covered; Provisions for drinking fountains and other elements covered by the standards also apply the criteria for operable parts; Exempt:  floor receptacles and operable parts used only by service or maintenance personnel.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter3/3op2-text.jpg){: .img-large}

#### Examples of Operable Parts in Kitchens

Labels and notes:  Electrical outlets, switches, and faucet controls are required to comply; Appliance controls and handles to accessible storage are also covered as operable parts; Controls on elements outside reach range, such as range hoods, require provision of a second control; If redundant controls (other than light switches) are provided for an element, one control in each space is not required to comply; Exempt:  HVAC diffusers and dedicated electrical or communication receptacles.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter3/3op3-text.jpg){: .img-large}

### Operable Parts

[[§309](/guidelines-and-standards/buildings-and-sites/about-the-aba-standards/aba-standards/chapter-3-building-blocks#309%20Operable%20Parts)]

Requirements apply generally to all types of operable parts covered. They are also referenced by technical sections of the standards covering drinking fountains, faucet and flush controls, ATM and fare machines, appliances, storage, windows, and door and gate hardware, and other elements.

### Accessible Features of Operable Parts

![Person using wheelchair at fire extinguisher cabinet with labels noting:  operable portions meet usability criteria and are within accessible reach ranges (non-operable portions can be located outside reach range); clear floor space for approach and positioning; and an unobstructed side of the clear floor space adjoins a connecting accessible route.]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter3/3op4-text.jpg){: .img-large}

#### Forward and Side Approaches

At most elements, clear floor space can be positioned for either a forward approach or a side approach. A forward approach is required at some elements, such as drinking fountains and lavatories, for easier access.

#### Forward Approach and Reach

    </div>
</div>

Additional clearance is required if the space is obstructed on three sides for more than half the depth to allow easier maneuvering into the space.

  </div>

#### Side Reach Radius

Elements located in corners can be difficult to reach from a side approach.

The standards include advisory (non-mandatory) reach ranges based on children’s dimensions that can be followed when operable parts are designed for use by children. This guidance provides reach ranges recommended according to three age groups.

### Operation

    <span class="grid-line text-italic" style="font-size: 90%">Operability with a closed fist is a reliable test of usability, but is not required by the standards.</span>
</div>
Operable parts must be usable with one hand and not require:
<ul>
<li>tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist, or</li>
<li>more than 5 pounds of force (lbf) to operate.</li>
</ul>

Parts that can be operated without hand or finger dexterity, fine motor movement, or simultaneous actions provide easier access and accommodate a broader range of users.

However, non-fixed portions of locks and other operable parts, such as keys and access cards, are not required to comply (but those that do not require pinching or turning provide better access). Hardware that does not require simultaneous actions are better, but some types, such as handles with thumb latches are acceptable."

### Common Questions

![question mark]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}ques.jpg){: .float-right .thumbnail}

#### Are redundant controls for an element required to comply?

If redundant controls, other than light switches, serve a single element, one control in each space is not required to comply. If a redundant control is located in a different space, however, it must comply. All light switches are required to comply.

#### What types of electrical or communication receptacles are exempt because they serve a “dedicated use”?

Electrical receptacles serving a dedicated use include those installed for appliances, including refrigerators, ranges, and dishwashers, and wall clocks. Floor electrical receptacles are also exempt. Communication receptacles serving a dedicated use include phone jacks, data ports, network and audio-visual connections. Electrical receptacles provided for portable communication devices such as TTYs are not covered by this exception and must comply.

#### Do reach range requirements apply to elements or only to operable parts of elements?

Reach range requirements apply to the operable portions of elements, including handles, controls, switches, buttons, control pads and other mechanisms that must be activated or manipulated for use. Non-operable portions of elements do not have to be within accessible reach ranges.

#### Must operable parts be usable with a closed fist?

Closed-fist operation is a good performance test but is not required by the standards. Many types of operable parts, such as pull handles, satisfy the requirements even though they may not be operable with a closed fist.

#### Are turn-key locks prohibited by the standards?

Key locks or key cards are not prohibited by the standards which apply only to the fixed portions of operable parts. Similarly, items dispensed by ATMs and fare machines, such as receipts, cash, fare cards, and vending machine products are not covered by the standards.
