###  Accessible Swimming Pools and Spas

The guidelines described in this guide focus on newly designed or newly
constructed and altered swimming pools, wading pools, aquatic recreation
facilities, and spas. Other provisions contained in ADAAG address
elements commonly found at a swimming facility, such as accessible
vehicle parking spaces, exterior accessible routes, and toilet and
bathing facilities. ADAAG addresses only the built environment
(structures and grounds); the guidelines do not address operational
issues. Questions regarding operational issues should be directed to the
Department of Justice, 1-800-514-0301 or 1-800-514-0383 (TTY).

---

### Accessible Routes

Accessible routes are continuous, unobstructed paths connecting all
accessible elements and spaces of a building or facility. Accessible
route requirements in ADAAG address width (minimum of 36 inches),
passing space, head room, surface, slope (maximum of 1:12 or 8.33%),
changes in level, doors, egress, and areas of rescue assistance, unless
modified by specific provisions outlined in this guide. An accessible
route is required to provide access to the swimming areas and all the
supporting amenities. An accessible route is not required to serve
raised diving boards, platforms, or water slides.

### Types of Facilities and Required Means of Entry into the Water

#### Swimming Pools

![illustration of large pool showing the required two means of
access]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter10/pool-guide/page-7hi.jpg){: .img-right}

Large pools must have a minimum of two accessible means of entry.  A
large pool is defined as any pool with over 300 linear feet of pool
wall.  Pool walls at diving areas and in areas where swimmers cannot
enter because of landscaping or adjacent structures are still counted as
part of the pool's total linear feet.

The primary means of entry must be either a sloped entry into the water
or a pool lift that is capable of being independently operated by a
person with a disability.  The secondary means of entry could be a pool
lift, sloped entry, transfer wall, transfer system, or pool stairs.  It
is recommended that where two means of entry are provided, they be
different types and be situated on different pool walls.

Pools with less than 300 linear feet of pool wall are only required to
provide one accessible means of entry, which must be either a pool lift
or sloped entry.

#### Aquatic Recreation Facilities

![photo of individual entering a wave action
pool]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter10/pool-guide/page-8hi.jpg){: .img-right}
Wave action pools, leisure rivers, sand bottom pools, and other pools
where access to the water is limited to one area and where everyone gets
in and out at the same place, must provide at least one accessible means
of entry, no matter how many linear feet of pool wall is provided. The
accessible means of entry can be either a pool lift, sloped entry, or
transfer system.

#### Catch Pools

A catch pool is a body of water where water slide flumes drop users into
the water.  An accessible means of entry or exit is not required into
the catch pool. However, an accessible route must connect to the edge of
the catch pool.

#### Wading Pools

A wading pool is a pool designed for shallow depth and is used for
wading.  Each wading pool must provide at least one sloped entry into
the deepest part. Other forms of entry may be provided as long as a
sloped entry is provided.  The sloped entries for wading pools are not
required to have handrails.

#### Spas

![photo of lift on a spa]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter10/pool-guide/page-8lo.jpg){: .img-right}
Spas must provide at least one accessible means of entry, which can be a
pool lift, transfer wall, or transfer system.  If spas are provided in a
cluster, 5 percent of the total --- or at least one spa --- must be
accessible.  If there is more than one cluster, one spa or 5 percent per
cluster must be accessible.

Footrests are not required on pool lifts provided at spas.  However,
footrests or retractable leg supports are encouraged, especially on
lifts used in larger spas, where the water depth is 34 inches or more
and there is sufficient space.

### Pool Lifts

#### Lifts

![illustration of pool
lift]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter10/pool-guide/page-pool9.jpg){: .img-right}
Pool lifts must be located where the water level is not deeper than 48
inches. This provides the opportunity for someone to provide assistance
from a standing position in the water if desired. If multiple pool lift
locations are provided, only one must be where the water is less than 48
inches. If the entire pool is deeper than 48 inches, an exception allows
operators to use a pool lift in any location as an accessible means of
entry.

#### Seats

There are a variety of seats available on pool lifts and these
guidelines do not specify the type of material or the type of seat
required. However, lift seats must be a minimum of 16 inches wide. In
the raised (load) position, the centerline of the seat must be located
over the deck, a minimum of 16 inches from the edge of the pool. The
deck surface between the centerline of the seat and the pool edge cannot
have a slope greater than 1:48.

Although not required, seats with backs will enable a larger number of
persons with disabilities to use the lift independently. Pool lift seats
made of materials that resist corrosion, that provide a firm base, and
that are padded are more usable. Headrests, seat belts, and additional
leg support may also enhance accessibility and accommodate a wider
variety of people with disabilities.

#### Clear Deck Space

Clear deck space must be provided to enable a person to get close enough
to the pool lift seat to easily transfer from a wheelchair or mobility
device. This clear deck space will ensure an unobstructed area for
transfers between a mobility device and the seat. The clear deck space
must be a minimum of 36 inches wide and extend forward a minimum of 48
inches from a line located 12 inches behind the rear edge of the seat.
This space must be located on the side of the seat opposite the water.
The slope of the clear deck space must not be greater than 1:48 (2%).
This virtually flat area will make the transfer easier and safer, while
still allowing water to drain away from the deck.

#### Seat Height

![aquatic access for inc1]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter10/pool-guide/aquatic_access_inc1.jpg){: .img-right}
The lift must be designed so that the seat will make a stop between a
minimum of 16 inches and maximum of 19 inches (measured from the deck to
the top of the seat surface, when the seat is in the raised position).
Lifts can provide additional stops at various heights to accommodate
users of all ages and abilities.

#### Footrests and Armrests

Footrests and armrests provide stability for the person using the pool
lift. Footrests must be provided on pool lifts, and must move together
with the seat. Padding on footrests ---large enough to support the whole
foot---reduces the chance of injury.

Armrests are not required, however if provided, the armrest opposite the
water must be removable or be able to fold clear of the seat when the
seat is in the raised (load) position. This clearance is needed for
people transferring between the lift and a mobility device.

#### Operation

Lifts must be designed and placed so that people can use them without
assistance, although assistance can be provided if needed. A person must
be able to call the lift when it is in either the deck or water
position. It is especially important for someone who is swimming alone
to be able to call the lift so she or he won't be stranded in the water
for an extended period of time.

The controls and operating mechanisms must be unobstructed when a lift
is in use. A person must be able to use the lift with one hand, and the
operating controls must not require tight grasping, pinching, or
twisting of the wrist. Controls may not require more than five pounds of
pressure to operate.

#### Submerged Depth

![illustration of pool lift submerged
depth]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter10/pool-guide/page-pool11.jpg){: .img-right}
Lifts must be designed so that the seat will submerge to a minimum of 18
inches below the stationary water level. This will ensure buoyancy for
the person on the lift and make it easier to enter or exit.

#### Lifting Capacity

Lifts must have the capability of supporting a minimum weight of 300
pounds and be capable of sustaining a static load that is at least 1.5
times the rated load. Where possible, lifts that can support a greater
weight capacity are encouraged.

---

### Sloped Entry

![photo of individual using a sloped
entry]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter10/pool-guide/poolramp.jpg){: .img-right}
Sloped entries must comply with ADAAG accessible route provisions (36 inch minimum width, maximum 1:12 or 8.33% slope), except
that the surface does not need to be slip resistant. The slope may be
designed as zero grade beach or ramp access. With either design, the
maximum slope permitted is 1:12 (8.33%).

In most cases, it is not appropriate to submerge personal wheelchairs
and mobility devices in water. Some have batteries, motors, and
electrical systems that can be damaged or contaminate the pool.
Facilities that use sloped entries are encouraged to provide an aquatic
wheelchair designed for access into the water. Persons transfer to the
aquatic wheelchair and access the water using it, leaving their personal
mobility device on the deck. Operators and facility managers may need to
consider storage options for personal mobility devices if deck space is
limited.

![illustration of sloped entry
ramp]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter10/pool-guide/page-pool12.jpg){: .img-full}

#### Submerged Depth

Sloped entries must extend to a depth between 24 inches minimum and 30
inches maximum below the stationary water level. This depth is necessary
for individuals using the sloped entry to become buoyant. Where the
sloped entry has a running slope greater than 1:20 (5%), a landing at
both the top and bottom of the ramp is required. At least one landing
must be located between 24 and 30 inches below the stationary water
level. Landings must be a minimum of 36 inches in width and 60 inches in
length. The sloped entry may be a maximum of 30 feet at 1:12 (8.33%)
slope before an intermediate landing is required. Adding a solid wall on
the side closest to the water can enhance safety.

#### Handrails

Sloped entries must have handrails on both sides regardless of the
slope. Handrail extensions are required at the top landing but not at
the bottom. The clear width between handrails must be between 33 and 38
inches. The handrail height must be between 34 and 38 inches to the top
of the gripping surface. This provision does not require the handrails
to be below the stationary water level, which could be considered an
underwater obstruction. No minimum width is required between handrails
provided on sloped entries that serve wave action pools, leisure rivers,
sand bottom pools, and other pools where people can enter only in one
place. Handrails are required to comply with ADAAG provisions (diameter,
non-rotating, and height).

### Transfer Walls

![2 illustrations showing transfer wall with one grab bar and transfer
wall with two grab
bars]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter10/pool-guide/page-pool14.jpg){: .img-right}
A transfer wall is a wall along an accessible route that
allows a person to leave a mobility device and transfer onto the wall
and then into a pool or spa.

#### Grab Bars

Transfer walls must have at least one grab bar. Grab bars must be
perpendicular to the pool wall and extend the full width of the wall so
a person can use them for support into the water. The top of the
gripping surface must be 4 to 6 inches above the wall to provide
leverage to the person using the bars. If only one bar is provided, the
clearance must be a minimum of 24 inches on each side of the bar. If two
bars are provided, the clearance must be a minimum of 24 inches between
the bars. The diameter of the grab bars must comply with ADAAG (diameter
between 1.25 and 1.5 inches, not abrasive, and non-rotating).

#### Clear Deck Space

Clear deck space of 60 by 60 inches minimum, with a slope of not more
than 1:48, must be provided at the base of a transfer wall. This will
allow persons using a wheelchair to turn around and access the wall,
depending on the side they can best use to transfer. If there is one
grab bar on a transfer wall, the clear deck space must be centered on
the one grab bar. That allows enough space for a transfer on either side
of the bar. If two bars are provided, the clear deck space must be
centered on the 24-inch clearance between the two bars.

#### Height

The transfer wall height must be 16 inches minimum to 19 inches maximum,
measured from the deck.

#### Width and Length

Transfer walls must be a minimum of 12 inches wide to a maximum of 16
inches wide. This provides enough space for a person to sit comfortably
on the surface of the wall and pivot to access the water. The wall must
be a minimum of 60 inches long and must be centered on the clear deck
space. Additional length will provide increased space and options for
transferring.

#### Surface

Since people using transfer walls are in bathing suits, their skin may
be in contact with the wall. To prevent injuries, the wall surface must
have rounded edges and not be sharp.

---

### Transfer System

![illustration of transfer system platform and
steps]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter10/pool-guide/page-pool16.jpg){: .img-right}
A transfer system consists of a transfer platform and a
series of transfer steps that descend into the water. Users need to
transfer from their wheelchair or mobility device to the transfer
platform and continue transferring into the water, step by step, bumping
their way in or out of the pool.

#### Transfer Platform

Each transfer system must have a platform on the deck surface so users
can maneuver on and off the system from their mobility device or
wheelchair. Platforms must be a minimum of 19 inches deep by 24 inches
wide. That provides enough room for a person transferring to maintain
balance and provides enough space to maneuver on top of it.

#### Platform Height

Transfer platforms must be between 16 and 19 inches high, measured from
the deck.

#### Clear Deck Space

![illustration of clear deck space located at a
transfer system]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter10/pool-guide/page-17.jpg){: .img-right}
The base of the transfer platform must have a clear deck space adjacent
to it that is 60 by 60 inches minimum, with a slope not steeper than
1:48 so a person using a wheelchair can turn around and maneuver into
transfer position. The space must be centered along the 24-inch minimum
unobstructed side of the transfer platform. A level, unobstructed space
will help a person transferring from a mobility device.

#### Transfer Steps

The maximum height of transfer steps is 8 inches, although shorter
heights are recommended. Each transfer step must have a tread depth of
14 inches minimum to 17 inches maximum and a minimum tread width of 24
inches. The steps must extend into the water a minimum of 18 inches
below the stationary water level.

#### Surface

The surface of the transfer platform and steps must not be sharp and
must have rounded edges to prevent injuries.

![illustration of continuous grab bar at transfer
system]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter10/pool-guide/page-18hi.jpg){: .img-medium .center}

#### Grab Bars

A grab bar must be provided on at least one side of each step and on the
transfer platform (shown on page 16), or as a continuous grab bar
serving each step and the platform (shown at left). The bar must not
obstruct transfer onto the platform. If a grab bar is provided on each
step, the top of the gripping surface must be 4 inches minimum to 6
inches maximum above each step. If a continuous bar is provided, the top
of the gripping surface must be 4 inches minimum to 6 inches maximum
above each step nosing. Grab bars on transfer systems must comply with
ADAAG (diameter between 1.25 and 1.5 inches, not abrasive, and
non-rotating).

---

### Accessible Pool Stairs

![illustration of pool
stairs]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter10/pool-guide/page-18lo.jpg){: .img-right}
Accessible pool stairs are designed to provide assistance
with balance and support from a standing position when moving from the
pool deck into the water and out. ADAAG provisions for stairs include
the requirement that all steps have uniform riser heights and uniform
tread widths of not less than 11 inches, measured from riser to riser.
Additionally, open risers are not permitted. Other stairs or steps
provided in the pool are not required to meet these guidelines.

#### Handrails

Pool stairs must have handrails with a minimum width between the rails
of 20 inches and a maximum of 24 inches. The 20- to 24-inch width for
the accessible pool stairs is intended to provide support for
individuals with disabilities who are ambulatory. Handrail extensions
are required on the top landing of the stairs but are not required at
the bottom landing. Handrails on pool stairs must comply with ADAAG
provisions. The top of the handrail gripping surface must be a minimum
of 34 inches and a maximum of 38 inches above the stair nosing. If
handrails are mounted on walls, the clear space between the handrail and
wall must be 1.5 inches.

---

###  Water Play Components

![water play
structure]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image-directory }}chapter10/pool-guide/pool-play.jpg){: .img-right}
If water play components are provided, they must comply
with the Access Board's Play Area Guidelines and accessible route
provisions.

If the surface of the accessible route, clear floor or ground spaces,
and turning spaces that connect play components are submerged, the
accessible route does not have to comply with the requirements for cross
slope, running slope, and surface conditions. Transfer systems may be
used instead of ramps to connect elevated water play components.

---

### Other Accessible Elements

If swimming pools are part of a multi-use facility, designers and
operators must also comply with ADAAG and all applicable requirements
for recreation facilities. These include, but are not limited to:

-   Dressing, fitting, and locker rooms
-   Exercise equipment and machines
-   Areas of sports activities (court sports, sports fields, etc.)
-   Play areas
-   Saunas and steam rooms

\* The guide uses the term ADAAG (Americans with Disabilities Act
Accessibility Guidelines) as the basis of the requirements discussed.
 The recreational provisions of these guidelines were adopted into the
2010 ADA Standards without changes, so the ADAAG section numbers
correspond to the same section numbers in the ADA Standards (as well as
the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) Accessibility Standards).
