  <p class="dot1desc">These Revised 508 Standards, which consist of 508 Chapters 1 and 2 (Appendix A), along with
    Chapters 3 through 7 (Appendix C), contain scoping and technical requirements for information and communication
    technology (ICT) to ensure accessibility and usability by individuals with disabilities. Compliance with these
    standards is mandatory for Federal agencies subject to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29
    U.S.C. 794d).</p>
  <h4 id="E101.2">E101.2 Equivalent Facilitation</h4>
  <p class="dot1desc">The use of an alternative design or technology that results in substantially equivalent or greater
    accessibility and usability by individuals with disabilities than would be provided by conformance to one or more of
    the requirements in Chapters 4 and 5 of the Revised 508 Standards is permitted. The functional performance criteria
    in Chapter 3 shall be used to determine whether substantially equivalent or greater accessibility and usability is
    provided to individuals with disabilities.</p>
  <h4 id="E101.3">E101.3 Conventional Industry Tolerances</h4>
  <p class="dot1desc">Dimensions are subject to conventional industry tolerances except where dimensions are stated as a
    range with specific minimum or maximum end points.</p>
  <h4 id="E101.4">E101.4 Units of Measurement</h4>
  <p class="dot1desc">Measurements are stated in metric and U.S. customary units. The values stated in each system
    (metric and U.S. customary units) may not be exact equivalents, and each system shall be used independently of the
    other.</p>
  <h3 id="E102-referenced-standards">E102 Referenced Standards</h3>

        instruct it to perform a given task or function. Software includes, but is not limited to, applications, non-Web
        software, and platform software.</dd>
      <dt>Software Tools</dt>
      <dd> Software for which the primary function is the development of other software. Software tools usually come in
        the form of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and are a suite of related products and utilities.
