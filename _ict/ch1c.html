  <h4 id="C101.1">C101.1 Purpose</h4>
  <p class="dot1desc">These Revised 255 Guidelines, which consist of 255 Chapters 1 and 2 (Appendix B), along with
    Chapters 3 through 7 (Appendix C), contain scoping and technical requirements for the design, development, and
    fabrication of telecommunications equipment and customer premises equipment, content, and support documentation and
    services, to ensure accessibility and usability by individuals with disabilities. These Revised 255 Guidelines are
    to be applied to the extent required by regulations issued by the Federal Communications Commission under Section
    255 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 U.S.C. 255).</p>
  <h4 id="C101.2">C101.2 Equivalent Facilitation </h4>
  <p class="dot1desc">The use of an alternative design or technology that results in substantially equivalent or greater
    accessibility and usability by individuals with disabilities than would be provided by conformance to one or more of
    the requirements in Chapters 4 and 5 of the Revised 255 Guidelines is permitted. The functional performance criteria
    in Chapter 3 shall be used to determine whether substantially equivalent or greater accessibility and usability is
    provided to individuals with disabilities.</p>
  <h4 id="C101.3">C101.3 Conventional Industry Tolerances</h4>
  <p class="dot1desc">Dimensions are subject to conventional industry tolerances except where dimensions are stated as a
    range with specific minimum or maximum end points.</p>
  <h4 id="C101.4">C101.4 Units of Measurement</h4>
  <p class="dot1desc">Measurements are stated in metric and U.S. customary units. The values stated in each system
    (metric and U.S. customary units) may not be exact equivalents, and each system shall be used independently of the
    other.</p>
  <h3 id="C102-referenced-standards">C102 Referenced Standards </h3>
  <h4 id="C102.1">C102.1 Application</h4>
  <p class="dot1desc">The specific editions of the standards listed in Chapter 7 are incorporated by reference into 255
    Chapter 2 (Scoping Requirements) and Chapters 3 through 6 to the prescribed extent of each such reference. Where
    conflicts occur between the Revised 255 Guidelines and the referenced standards, these Revised 255 Guidelines apply.

  <dl>
    <dt>Application</dt>
    <dd> Software designed to perform, or to help the user perform, a specific task or tasks.</dd>
    <dt>Assistive Technology (AT)</dt>

    <dt>Audio Description</dt>
    <dd> Narration added to the soundtrack to describe important visual details that cannot be understood from the main
      soundtrack alone. Audio description is a means to inform individuals who are blind or who have low vision about
      visual content essential for comprehension. Audio description of video provides information about actions,
      characters, scene changes, on-screen text, and other visual content. Audio description supplements the regular
      audio track of a program. Audio description is usually added during existing pauses in dialogue. Audio description
      is also called "video description" and "descriptive narration."</dd>
    <dt>Authoring Tool</dt>
    <dd> Any software, or collection of software components, that can be used by authors, alone or collaboratively, to
      create or modify content for use by others, including other authors.</dd>

      telecommunications function of such equipment. Examples of CPE are telephones, routers, switches, residential
      gateways, set-top boxes, fixed mobile convergence products, home networking adaptors and Internet access gateways
      which enable consumers to access communications service providers' services and distribute them around their house
      via a Local Access Network (LAN).</dd>
    <dt>Document</dt>
