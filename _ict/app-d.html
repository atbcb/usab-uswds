    </p>
    <h2 id="subpart_a">Subpart A — General</h2>
    <h3 id="d1">§ D1194.1 Purpose.</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this part is to implement section 508 of the <a
            href="{{ site.baseurl }}/laws/ra.html">Rehabilitation Act of
            1973</a>, as amended (<a
            href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2011-title29/USCODE-2011-title29-chap16-subchapV-sec794d">29
            U.S.C. 794d</a>).&nbsp; Section 508 requires that when Federal
        agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology,
        Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data
        that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not
        individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the
        agency.&nbsp; Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are
        members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have
        access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the
        public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be
        imposed on the agency.</p>
    <h3 id="d2">§ D1194.2 Application.</h3>
    <p id="d2a">(a) Products covered by this part shall comply with all applicable
        provisions of this part. When developing, procuring, maintaining, or using
        electronic and information technology, each agency shall ensure that the products
        comply with the applicable provisions of this part, unless an undue burden would be
        imposed on the agency.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p id="d2a1">(1) When compliance with the provisions of this part imposes an
            undue burden, agencies shall provide individuals with disabilities with the
            information and data involved by an alternative means of access that allows the
            individual to use the information and data.</p>
        <p id="d2a2">(2) When procuring a product, if an agency determines that
            compliance with any provision of this part imposes an undue burden, the
            documentation by the agency supporting the procurement shall explain why, and to
            what extent, compliance with each such provision creates an undue burden.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p id="d2b">(b) When procuring a product, each agency shall procure products
        which comply with the provisions in this part when such products are available in
        the commercial marketplace or when such products are developed in response to a
        Government solicitation.&nbsp; Agencies cannot claim a product as a whole is not
        commercially available because no product in the marketplace meets all the
        standards.&nbsp; If products are commercially available that meet some but not all
        of the standards, the agency must procure the product that best meets the standards.
    </p>
    <p id="d2c">(c) Except as provided by <a href="#d3b">§1194.3(b)</a>, this part applies to
        electronic and information technology developed, procured, maintained, or used by
        agencies directly or used by a contractor under a contract with an agency which
        requires the use of such product, or requires the use, to a significant extent, of
        such product in the performance of a service or the furnishing of a product.</p>
    <h3 id="d3">§ 1194.3 General exceptions.</h3>
    <p id="d3a">(a) This part does not apply to any electronic and information
        technology operated by agencies, the function, operation, or use of which involves
        intelligence activities, cryptologic activities related to national security,
        command and control of military forces, equipment that is an integral part of a
        weapon or weapons system, or systems which are critical to the direct fulfillment of
        military or intelligence missions.&nbsp; Systems which are critical to the direct
        fulfillment of military or intelligence missions do not include a system that is to
        be used for routine administrative and business applications (including payroll,
        finance, logistics, and personnel management applications).</p>
    <p id="d3b">(b) This part does not apply to electronic and information
        technology that is acquired by a contractor incidental to a contract.</p>
    <p id="d3c">(c) Except as required to comply with the provisions in this part,
        this part does not require the installation of specific accessibility-related
        software or the attachment of an assistive technology device at a workstation of a
        Federal employee who is not an individual with a disability.</p>
    <p id="d3d">(d) When agencies provide access to the public to information or
        data through electronic and information technology, agencies are not required to
        make products owned by the agency available for access and use by individuals with
        disabilities at a location other than that where the electronic and information
        technology is provided to the public, or to purchase products for access and use by
        individuals with disabilities at a location other than that where the electronic and
        information technology is provided to the public.</p>
    <p id="d3e">(e) This part shall not be construed to require a fundamental
        alteration in the nature of a product or its components.</p>
    <p id="d3f">(f) Products located in spaces frequented only by service personnel
        for maintenance, repair, or occasional monitoring of equipment are not required to
        comply with this part.</p>

        maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities.</dd>
    <dt>Electronic and information technology</dt> <dd>Includes information technology
        and any equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment, that is used
        in the creation, conversion, or duplication of data or information. The term

        information technology that is used as an integral part of the product, but the
        principal function of which is not the acquisition, storage, manipulation,
        management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or
        reception of data or information. For example, HVAC (heating, ventilation, and
        air conditioning) equipment such as thermostats or temperature control devices, and
        medical equipment where information technology is integral to its operation, are not
        information technology.</dd>

        limited to, information kiosks and information transaction machines, copiers,
        printers, calculators, fax machines, and other similar types of products.</dd>
    <dt>Telecommunications</dt> <dd>The transmission, between or among points
        specified by the user, of information of the user’s choosing, without change in the
        form or content of the information as sent and received.</dd>
    <dt>TTY</dt> <dd>An abbreviation for teletypewriter. Machinery or equipment
        that employs interactive text based communications through the transmission of coded
        signals across the telephone network. TTYs may include, for example, devices

        telephones.</dd>
    <dt>Undue burden</dt> <dd>Undue burden means significant difficulty or
        expense. In determining whether an action would result in an undue burden, an
