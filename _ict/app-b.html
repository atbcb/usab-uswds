    Chapters 3 through 7 (Appendix C), contain scoping and technical requirements for the design, development, and
    fabrication of telecommunications equipment and customer premises equipment, content, and support documentation and
    services, to ensure accessibility and usability by individuals with disabilities. These Revised 255 Guidelines are
    to be applied to the extent required by regulations issued by the Federal Communications Commission under Section
    255 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 U.S.C. 255).</p>

  <p class="dot1desc">The use of an alternative design or technology that results in substantially equivalent or greater
    accessibility and usability by individuals with disabilities than would be provided by conformance to one or more of
    the requirements in Chapters 4 and 5 of the Revised 255 Guidelines is permitted. The functional performance criteria
    in Chapter 3 shall be used to determine whether substantially equivalent or greater accessibility and usability is
    provided to individuals with disabilities.</p>
  <h4 id="C101.3">C101.3 Conventional Industry Tolerances</h4>

  <p class="dot1desc">Measurements are stated in metric and U.S. customary units. The values stated in each system
    (metric and U.S. customary units) may not be exact equivalents, and each system shall be used independently of the
    other.</p>
