									<dt>Telecommunications</dt>
										<dd> The signal transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of information of the user’s choosing, without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received.</dd>
									<dt>Terminal</dt>
										<dd> Device or software with which the end user directly interacts and that provides the user interface. For some systems, the software that provides the user interface may reside on more than one device such as a telephone and a server.</dd>
