  <h4 id="E101.1">E101.1 Purpose</h4>
  <p class="dot1desc">These Revised 508 Standards, which consist of 508 Chapters 1 and 2 (Appendix A), along with
    Chapters 3 through 7 (Appendix C), contain scoping and technical requirements for information and communication
    technology (ICT) to ensure accessibility and usability by individuals with disabilities. Compliance with these
    standards is mandatory for Federal agencies subject to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29
    U.S.C. 794d).</p>
  <h4 id="E101.2">E101.2 Equivalent Facilitation</h4>
  <p class="dot1desc">The use of an alternative design or technology that results in substantially equivalent or greater
    accessibility and usability by individuals with disabilities than would be provided by conformance to one or more of
    the requirements in Chapters 4 and 5 of the Revised 508 Standards is permitted. The functional performance criteria
    in Chapter 3 shall be used to determine whether substantially equivalent or greater accessibility and usability is
    provided to individuals with disabilities.</p>
  <h4 id="E101.3">E101.3 Conventional Industry Tolerances</h4>
  <p class="dot1desc">Dimensions are subject to conventional industry tolerances except where dimensions are stated as a
    range with specific minimum or maximum end points.</p>
  <h4 id="E101.4">E101.4 Units of Measurement</h4>
  <p class="dot1desc">Measurements are stated in metric and U.S. customary units. The values stated in each system
    (metric and U.S. customary units) may not be exact equivalents, and each system shall be used independently of the
    other.</p>
  <h3 id="E102-referenced-standards">E102 Referenced Standards</h3>
  <h4 id="E102.1">E102.1 Application</h4>
  <p class="dot1desc">The specific editions of the standards listed in Chapter 7 are incorporated by reference into 508
    Chapter 2 (Scoping Requirements) and Chapters 3 through 6 to the prescribed extent of each such reference. Where
    conflicts occur between the Revised 508 Standards and the referenced standards, these Revised 508 Standards apply.

  <p class="dot1desc">Terms defined in referenced standards and not defined in E103.4 shall have the meaning as defined
    in the referenced standards.</p>
  <h4 id="E103.2">E103.2 Undefined Terms</h4>
  <p class="dot1desc">Any term not defined in E103.4 or in referenced standards shall be given its ordinarily accepted
    meaning in the sense that the context implies.</p>
  <h4 id="E103.3">E103.3 Interchangeability</h4>
  <p class="dot1desc">Words, terms, and phrases used in the singular include the plural and those used in the plural
    include the singular.</p>

      <dd>Any agency or department of the United States as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502, and the United States Postal
        Service.</dd>
      <dt>Alteration</dt>
      <dd>A change to existing ICT that affects interoperability, the user interface, or access to information or data.
      </dd>
      <dt>Application.</dt>
      <dd>Software designed to perform, or to help the user to perform, a specific task or tasks.</dd>
      <dt>Assistive Technology (AT)</dt>
      <dd>Any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially, modified, or customized, that

      <dt>Audio Description.</dt>
      <dd>Narration added to the soundtrack to describe important visual details that cannot be understood from the main
        soundtrack alone. Audio description is a means to inform individuals who are blind or who have low vision about
        visual content essential for comprehension. Audio description of video provides information about actions,
        characters, scene changes, on-screen text, and other visual content. Audio description supplements the regular
        audio track of a program. Audio description is usually added during existing pauses in dialogue. Audio
        description is also called "video description" and "descriptive narration".</dd>
      <dt>Authoring Tool</dt>
      <dd>Any software, or collection of software components, that can be used by authors, alone or collaboratively, to
        create or modify content for use by others, including other authors.</dd>
      <dt>Closed Functionality</dt>
      <dd>Characteristics that limit functionality or prevent a user from attaching or installing assistive technology.
        Examples of ICT with closed functionality are self-service machines, information kiosks, set-top boxes, fax
        machines, calculators, and computers that are locked down so that users may not adjust settings due to a policy
        such as Desktop Core Configuration.</dd>
