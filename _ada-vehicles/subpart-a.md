High speed rail
: an intercity-type rail service which operates primarily on a dedicated guideway or track not used,for the most part, by freight, including, but not limited to, trains on welded rail, magnetically levitated (maglev) vehicles on a special guideway, or other advanced technology vehicles, designed to travel at speeds in excess of those possible on other types of railroads.
