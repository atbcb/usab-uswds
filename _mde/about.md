### About the Accessibility Standards for Medical Diagnostic Equipment

![exam table]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/mde/mde.jpg){: .float-right .img-med}
The Access Board issued accessibility standards for medical diagnostic equipment (MDE) under the Rehabilitation Act.  These standards provide design criteria for examination tables and chairs, weight scales, radiological and mammography equipment, and other diagnostic equipment that are accessible to people with disabilities.  They include requirements for equipment that necessitates transfer from mobility aids and address transfer surfaces, support rails, armrests, and other features.  The Board developed the standards in consultation with the Food and Drug Administration.

As issued by the Board, the standards are not mandatory on health care providers and equipment manufacturers.  The Department of Justice may adopt them as mandatory requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Other federal agencies may implement them as well under the Rehabilitation Act which requires access to federally funded programs and services.
