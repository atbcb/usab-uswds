    The U.S. Access Board, an independent federal agency that issues
    accessibility guidelines under the
    <a href="https://beta.ada.gov/law-and-regs/ada/">
        Americans with Disabilities Act
    </a>
    (ADA),
    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/law/aba.html">
        Architectural Barriers Act
    </a>
    (ABA),
    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/law/ra.html">
        Rehabilitation Act of 1973
    </a>
    , and other laws, is providing a technical assistance document to assist in
    the design and construction of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations that
    are accessible to and usable by people with disabilities.
</p>
<p>
    The ADA covers entities including state and local governments (Title II)
    and places of public accommodation and commercial facilities (Title III).
    Accessibility guidelines issued under the ADA are based on minimum scoping
    and technical requirements set by the Access Board. Other federal agencies
    with enforcement responsibility under the ADA, such as the Department of
    Transportation (DOT) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), adopt enforceable
    standards that must provide at least the same level of accessibility as the
    guidelines issued by the Access Board. [Add something about program Access
    and DOJ and DOT regulations – Additional requirements under the DOJ ADA
    regulations and DOT ADA regulations may be applicable, such as requirements
    for nondiscrimination and program access.] For more information, visit the
Access Board’s    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/law/ada.html">About the ADA page</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The ABA requires that buildings or facilities that were designed, built, or
    altered with federal dollars or leased by federal agencies be accessible.
    The ABA covers a wide range of facilities, including U.S. post offices,
    Veterans Affairs medical facilities, national parks, Social Security
    Administration offices, federal office buildings, U.S. courthouses, and
    federal prisons. It also applies to certain non-government facilities
    constructed with federal funds, such as funds made available under the
    National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program. For more information,
visit the Access Board’s    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/law/aba.html">About the ABA page</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The ADA and ABA Accessibility Standards include many requirements
    applicable to electric vehicle charging stations, among which are
    provisions regarding access to sites, facilities, buildings, and elements,
    as well as specific requirements for operable parts and accessible routes.
    Even absent a specific reference to EV charging stations in the ADA and ABA
    Standards, regulated entities must still ensure that they are accessible to
    and usable by individuals with disabilities.
</p>
<p>
    Some EV chargers also have user interfaces and payment systems that would
    be considered information and communication technology (ICT). Section 508
    of the Rehabilitation Act requires individuals with disabilities have
    access to and use of ICT provided by the Federal government. The law
    applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or
    use ICT. Federal agencies must ensure that any ICT that is part of an EV
    charger is accessible to employees and members of the public with
    disabilities to the extent it does not pose an “undue burden.”
</p>
<p>
    In this technical assistance document, the Access Board uses the terms
    “must” or “required” with reference to the applicable ADA, ABA, and Section
    508 Standards with which entities must comply. The words “should” or
    “recommends” refer to additional recommendations for accessible EV charging
    stations. Recommendations are not legally binding on any regulated entity
    but are provided as technical assistance to help regulated entities design
    and install EV charging stations that are accessible to and usable by
    people with disabilities.

    The following image shows one charging station with two chargers. There are
    a total of three charging ports capable of charging three vehicles
    concurrently and four connectors.
</p>
<h1>
    Differences Between Charging Spaces and Parking Spaces
</h1>
<p>
    Although EV chargers are often installed in parking lots, there are some
    significant differences in use that warrant EV charging spaces be treated
    differently from parking spaces.
</p>
<p>
    EV charging requires drivers with disabilities to exit their vehicle,
    traverse to the charger, and carry the connector back to their vehicle
    charging inlet (which may be on the opposite side of where they enter/exit
    their EV). Since EV’s do not have a standard location for the vehicle
    charging inlet, maneuverability around the entire EV is needed. Also, as
    DCFC cables get heavier and shorter to achieve faster charging, EV’s need
    to be parked in a way that aligns the vehicle charging inlet with the
    charger, which could conflict with the orientation needed for a driver with
    a disability to use the access aisle.
</p>
<p>
    By contrast, a driver with a disability can use an accessible parking space
    as long as the vehicle is oriented with the access aisle; a person with a
    disability could either pull-in or back-in to the parking spot to get the
    access aisle on the appropriate side. The additional space provided by an
    access aisle is needed only by the person with a disability (who may be
    either a driver or passenger) and additional space on the opposite side of
    the vehicle is usually not needed.
</p>
<p>
    Because of this fundamental difference in use, this document differentiates
    between parking and EV charging, and primarily focuses on the needs of an
    EV driver with a disability. The needs of passengers with disabilities are
    not addressed in this document because it is presumed passengers with
    disabilities could enter or exit the vehicle at a nearby accessible parking
    space or passenger loading zone.

<h1>
    Existing Requirements that Apply to EV Charging Stations

<h1>
    Accessible EV Chargers
</h1>
<p>
    Unlike gas stations where an attendant may be available to assist with
    refueling vehicles, EV charging stations are often unattended. Thus, it is
    important that EV charging stations be sufficiently accessible to allow
    independent use by drivers with disabilities, including people who have
    limited or no hand dexterity, limb differences, or upper extremity
    amputations and use adaptive driving controls.
</p>
<p>
    Two aspects of accessibility need to be considered:
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Accessible mobility features </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    A reasonable number of EV chargers must have physical access for people who
    use mobility devices, such as wheelchairs, scooters, walkers, and canes.
    Accessible mobility features primarily concern the size of the vehicle
    charging space, providing access aisles, how and where the chargers are
    installed, and the physical operability of the charger. [Also see: Number
    of accessible chargers]
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Accessible communication features</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    All EV chargers should have accessible communication features and operable
    parts. This enables EV chargers to be used by people who are deaf or hard
    of hearing, little people, and other people with disabilities who do not
    need accessible mobility features (like access aisles) to use an EV
    charger.
</p>
<p>
    All EV chargers containing ICT that are developed, procured, maintained, or
    used by the federal government must comply with the Section 508 Standards
    and have accessible ICT, including accessible hardware, software, and
    operable parts.
</p>
<h1>
    Accessible Mobility Features
</h1>
<p>
    EV chargers designed to serve people who use mobility devices must be
    located on an accessible route and should provide:
</p>
<p>
    · a vehicle charging space at least 11 feet wide and 20 feet long
</p>
<p>
    · adjoining access aisle at least 5 feet wide
</p>
<p>
    · clear floor or ground space at the same level as the vehicle charging
    space and positioned for an unobstructed side reach
</p>
<p>
    · accessible operable parts, including on the charger and connector
</p>
<p>
    These mobility features allow sufficient space for a person who uses a
    mobility device to exit and maneuver around the vehicle, retrieve the EV
    connector, and plug the connector into the electric vehicle charging inlet.
    Since EVs do not have a uniform vehicle charging inlet location, a larger
    vehicle charging space is needed to maneuver around all sides of the
    electric vehicle.
</p>
<p>
    [Shift car towards access aisle, indicate 5 feet? Zoom in/crop]
</p>
<h2>
    Accessible Routes
</h2>
<p>
    EV chargers with accessible mobility features must be connected to an
accessible route (<a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-206_2_2">§206.2.2</a>;    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-402">§402</a>). The
    technical requirements for accessible routes can be found in
    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-402">
        Chapter 4 of the ADA
    </a>
    and <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/aba/#aba-402">ABA standards</a>
    as well as in the Access Board’s technical

        guides on accessible routes
    </a>
, including walking surfaces (<a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-403">§403</a>), curb ramps (<a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-406">§406</a>), and ramps (    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-405">§405</a>).
</p>
<p>
    [Image: EV charging station and accessible route requirements, minimum 32
    inches between bollards]
</p>
<h2>
    Electric Vehicle Charging Space and Access Aisle
</h2>
<p>
    EV charging spaces with mobility features should provide a vehicle space
    with a minimum width of at least 132 inches (11 feet) and a minimum length
    of at least 240 inches (20 feet). Adjacent to the vehicle charging space
    should be an access aisle that is at least 60 inches (5 feet) wide and the
    full length of the vehicle charging space. A vehicle charging space at
    least 11 feet wide and 20 feet long would provide sufficient space to
    maneuver around an electric car, but larger vehicle charging spaces may be
    needed for electric trucks.
</p>
<p>
    Where vehicle charging spaces are marked, access aisles should also be
    marked to discourage parking in them. State or local codes may have
    specific requirements for marking and signing access aisles (e.g., access
    aisle markings in blue or “no parking in access aisle” signs). The width of
    the vehicle charging spaces and access aisles is measured to the centerline
    of markings, but it can include the full width of lines where there is no
    adjacent vehicle space or access aisle.
</p>
<p>
    One access aisle may be shared by two vehicle charging spaces, or a
    charging space and a parking space, but overlap of the aisle should be
limited to 60 inches (5 feet). The exception in    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-502_2">§502.2</a> that leads
    to two 8-foot accessible parking spaces sharing an 8-foot access aisle
    should <u>not</u> be used for vehicle charging spaces because there would
    be insufficient space to access the vehicle charging inlets on the opposite
    side of the access aisle.
</p>
<p>
    Access aisles should not be blocked or obscured by curbs, wheel stops,
    bollards, or charging cable slack. Floor or ground surfaces should comply
    with <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-302">§302</a> and not
    have changes in level or slopes that exceed 1:48. For more information,
    please consult the Access Board’s

<h2>
    Access Aisle Relation to EV Charger
</h2>
<p>
    The access aisle must be connected by an accessible route to the clear
    floor or ground space at the EV charger.
</p>
<p>
    When charging cables are short, the charger should be positioned so that
    the operable parts and clear floor or ground space are on the same side as
    the access aisle. This configuration allows for placement of bollards to
    protect chargers without obstructing clear floor or ground space.
</p>
<p>
    EV chargers with long charging cables have more flexibility regarding
    placement. With long charging cables, chargers can be placed at the center
    of the vehicle space or access aisle, or between vehicle spaces, if ample
    room is available for maneuvering around and between bollards. For more
information, please consult sections <u>Clear Floor or Ground Space</u> and    <u>Example Charging Scenarios</u> of this technical assistance document.
</p>
<p>
    [When extra time, show this charger connected to a vehicle. Vehicle facing
    forward, three-foot space between vehicle and bollards, charger connected

</p>
<h2>
    Alignment of Charger with Location of Vehicle Charging Inlets
</h2>
<p>
    The placement of the vehicle charging inlet varies across make and model of
    EVs. This variety can create challenges to designing an EV charging space
    with accessible mobility features that can meet the needs of all types of
    EVs since the vehicle charging inlet needs to align closely to the charger,
    especially for DCFC with short charging cables. Generally, a person with a
    disability driving an EV will need the access aisle positioned on the
    driver’s side.

<p>
    When designing a charging station to serve multiple types of EV’s with
    various vehicle charging inlet locations, it is recommended to provide more
    mobility accessible vehicle charging spaces with a variety of access aisle
    locations and charger configurations.
</p>
<h3>
    Example Charging Scenarios
</h3>
<p>
    The scenarios below indicate how a vehicle’s orientation changes depending
    on the location of the vehicle charging inlet. This is particularly
    important for DCFCs with short and heavy charging cables. AC Level 2 and
    some DCFCs that have sufficiently long and light cables may not have this
    issue.
</p>
<p>
    B1 depicts an ideal scenario with the most common EV charging inlet
    location, which is on the driver side rear. When the vehicle is backed into
    the vehicle charging space, the driver side door is aligned with the access
    aisle and the vehicle charging inlet is close to the EV charger. The EV
    charger is located at the same level as the charging space and access aisle
    by depressing the curb to the same level as the asphalt. The EV charger has
    been rotated so that the clear floor or ground space is on the same side as
    the access aisle and not obstructed by bollards. Bollards are used instead
    of wheel stops to provide ample maneuverability around the vehicle.
</p>
<p>
    B2 depicts a vehicle backed into a charging space, but the vehicle’s
    charging inlet is located on either the rear or passenger side rear. While
    the access aisle is still aligned with the driver side door, the vehicle
    now needs to be spaced at least 36 inches (3 feet) away from the bollards
    in order for mobility device users to pass between the vehicle and bollards
    and reach a charging inlet located on the opposite side of the vehicle.
</p>
<p>
    F1 depicts a vehicle pulled forward into the EV charging space. The access
    aisle is now on the passenger side, but the vehicle charging inlet located
    on the passenger side front aligns closely with the EV charger. A mobility
    device user would need 5 feet of space on the driver’s side to exit the
    vehicle, and at least 3 feet of space to travel around the rear of the
    vehicle and to the EV charger. This may require the EV to partially overlap
    the access aisle. A vehicle charging space at least 11 feet wide and 20
    feet long would provide sufficient space to maneuver around an electric
    car. Large electric SUVs and trucks may need larger vehicle charging
    spaces.
</p>
<p>
    F2 depicts a similar scenario of a vehicle pulled forward into the vehicle
    charging space, but the vehicle charging inlets are either on the front or
    driver side front, which requires passing between the EV and bollards.
</p>
<p>
    Charging may not be achievable if cables are too short in scenarios F2 and
    B2. A better solution is to design the adjacent vehicle charging space to
    also have accessible mobility features. With two mobility accessible
    vehicle charging spaces sharing a common access aisle, a variety of
    charging inlet locations can be served. Longer charging cables should also
    be provided.
</p>
<p>
    Charging stations designed to serve specific vehicles with consistent and
    known vehicle charging inlet locations should provide access aisles on the
    driver side and ensure the vehicle charging inlets align closely with the
    EV charger.
</p>

</p>
<h2>
    Clear Floor or Ground Space
</h2>
<p>
    To provide accessibility for people who use mobility aids, such as
    wheelchairs, scooters, walkers, and canes, EV chargers must provide a clear
floor or ground space complying with    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-305">§305</a> and be located
    on an accessible route. Clear floor or ground spaces must meet requirements
    for ground and floor surfaces, including criteria for firmness, stability,
    and slip resistance. They must be free of changes in level and not sloped
    more than 1:48. Grass, curbs, wheel stops, and bollards may not be located
    within the clear floor or ground space.
</p>
<p>
    Clear floor or ground space at chargers must be a minimum of 30 inches by
    48 inches. Additional space may be required where the clear floor or ground
    space is confined on three sides and obstructed for more than half the
    depth (e.g., bollards, curbs, etc.).
</p>
<p>
    While both a forward approach and parallel approach are permitted under the
    ADA and ABA Standards, it is recommended that the clear floor or ground
    space be positioned for a parallel approach to the charger and centered on
    the operable part. If there are multiple operable parts, the clear floor or
    ground space should be centered on the EV charger.
</p>
<p>
    [Image: EV charger with single operable part off to the side, clear floor
    or ground space centered on that side]
</p>
<p>
    EV chargers are highly recommended to be installed at the same level as the
    vehicle charging space and access aisle so that the clear floor or ground
    space can be placed as close as possible to the EV charger. This design
    ensures people who use mobility devices can readily access chargers.
</p>
<p align="center">
    [Remove clear floor space on left side, or make space wider and access
    aisle]
</p>
<p>
    <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>
    : Avoid installing accessible EV chargers on top of or behind curbs. Where
    chargers are installed on or behind curbs, people using wheelchairs have
    very limited access to approaching and using them. Depending on users’
    ability, reaching the operable parts may be difficult if not impossible.
</p>
<p>
    Do not do this!
</p>
<p>
    If EV chargers must be installed on a curb, such as at on-street parking,
    place them as close to the edge of the face of the curb as possible and no
    farther than 10 inches away from the face of the curb.
</p>
<p>
    Alternatively, the EV charger and a clear floor or ground space can be
    placed up on the curb or sidewalk, but this design should only be used at
    existing curbs when it is technically infeasible to lower the curb or
    sidewalk. The front of the charger should not face the street or curb, and
    charging cables should be sufficiently long and light enough to allow
    mobility device users to travel back down the curb ramp and reach their
    vehicle charging inlet. Reaching some vehicle charging inlets may only be
    achievable with long charging cables, and DCFCs may be limited to charging
    only vehicles that have charging inlets that can be reached from the
    sidewalk. (Also see: <u>On-Street EV charging stations</u>)
</p>
<p>
    When possible, providing additional clear floor or ground space for a
    forward approach and turning space is recommended. Aligning the EV charger
    with the access aisle takes advantage of existing clear floor or ground
    space.

<h2>
    Operable Parts within Reach Range
</h2>
<p>
At a charging station, a reasonable number of EV chargers must comply with    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-205">§205 Operable Parts</a>
, including technical requirements for clear floor or ground space (    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-305">§305</a>), reach ranges
    (<a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-308">§308</a>), and
operation (    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-309"><u>§309</u>).</a> We
    recommend EV chargers be designed with parts that are operable by the
    widest range of users with disabilities, including people with limited or
    no hand dexterity, limb differences, or upper extremity amputations.
</p>
<p>
    Operable parts on EV chargers include, but are not limited to, the
    connector, card readers, electronic user interfaces, and switches and
    buttons, including the emergency start/stop button.
</p>
<h3>
    Unobstructed side reach
</h3>
<p>
    All operable parts should meet the requirements for an unobstructed side
    reach (<a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-308_3_1">§308.3.1</a>
    ) and be no higher than 48 inches above the clear floor or ground space and
    no farther than 10 inches away. The exception for fuel dispensers should
    not be used (See: fuel dispensers). Placing operable parts higher than the
    15 inch minimum is recommended.
</p>
<p>
    [Replace with EV charger specific image]
</p>
<p>
    The operable portion must be within an accessible reach range, but
    non-operable portions can be located outside of reach ranges. For example,
    a display screen that does not require user touch input, or has buttons
    located within reach range, can be located above 48 inches. Similarly a
    card reader that can be activated below 48 inches with a portion of the
    card reader above 48 inches would still be operable. The operable portion
    of the connector, particularly the release button and handle, should be
    below 48 inches. A connector with no release button that can be used
    without reaching above 48 inches would also be within reach range.
</p>
<h3>
    Connectors
</h3>
<p>
Connectors must meet the requirements for operable parts (    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-309">§309</a>), including
    operation with one hand and no tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the
    wrist, and no more than five (5) pounds of force to operate.
</p>
<p>
    Connectors generally have a release button that needs to be pressed to
    connect/disconnect the connector from the vehicle charging inlet.
    Simultaneously grasping the connector and pressing a release button can be
    challenging for people with limited hand dexterity. Connectors that are a
    consistent diameter and very smooth are also challenging because they
    require grasping, especially when cables and connectors are heavy.
</p>
<p>
    One way to informally test if an element is sufficiently accessible for a
    person with limited hand dexterity is to try operation of the element with
    a closed fist. Connector designs that have a handle with a release button
    on the inside, similar to a fuel dispenser, can be more accessible because
    a person can often place a closed fist inside of the handle and
    simultaneously pull on the connector and press the release button. The
    addition of straps and loops may also help a user carry the connector
    because it could be looped onto the user’s wrist or arm, or even hung on
    the user’s mobility device, to free both hands up to maneuver a mobility
    device (e.g. push a wheelchair, keep both hands on a walker etc.).
</p>
<p>
    Future connector designs that are more accessible are encouraged. Until
    more accessible connectors are available, some chargers may be limited to
    using connectors that require pressing a release button with the thumb.
</p>
<p>
    Manufacturers have developed automatic connection devices, which improve
    accessibility of EV charging because they eliminate the need to physically
    manipulate the connector. When possible, consider installing automatic
    connection devices, especially at fleet charging stations.
</p>
<h3>
    Charging Cables
</h3>
<p>
    The ADA and ABA Accessibility Standards require operable parts to be
    operable with no more than 5 pounds of force and to not require tight
    grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist.
</p>
<p>
    Light weight charging cables (AC Level 2, and some DCFCs) should be of
    sufficient length to charge a vehicle with various charging inlet
    locations.
</p>
<p>
    As thicker and heavier charging cables are used to achieve faster charging
    speeds, it becomes more difficult for people who use mobility devices to
    lift the cable and carry it back and forth to their vehicle charging inlet.
    Heavier and shorter DCFC cables should be able to charge a vehicle
    positioned at least 60 inches (5 feet) away and be installed so that users
    can access the vehicle charging inlet, access aisle, and charger.
</p>
<p>
    Charging cables cannot block or obstruct accessible routes when stored or
    when connected to vehicles. Cable management systems can be provided to
    prevent cable slack from accumulating on the ground and potentially offset
    the weight of heavier DCFC cables, but cable management systems must be
    kept in good condition to maintain the accessibility of the chargers.
    Overhead cable management systems may also be able to help with cable
    weight and operation, but the systems and cables must not become protruding
    objects.
</p>
<p>
    There are many promising solutions to the issue of heavy charging cables,
    including the use of cable management systems, automatic connection
    devices, and wireless charging, which could greatly improve accessibility.
    In the interim, however, the benefits of fast charging provide greater user
    convenience and should be available at accessible EV charging stations,
    even if the issue of charging cable weight has not been addressed. Persons
    with disabilities should still have access to DCFCs and not be restricted
    to AC Level 2 chargers. Future innovations may address the issue of
    charging cable weight and should be used when available to achieve
    accessible operation.
</p>
<h1>
    Accessible Communication Features
</h1>
<p>
    Accessible communication features enable people who are deaf or hard of
    hearing, people with vision impairments (but who drive), little people, and
    other people with disabilities who might not need accessible mobility
    features (like access aisles) to use an EV charger.
</p>
<p>
    All EV chargers should have accessible communication features and operable
    parts. All EV chargers that are procured or maintained by a federal agency
must comply with the    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/">Section 508 Standards</a>
    because they are Information Technology (IT).
    <em>
        See
        <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-36/chapter-XI/part-1194">

        , App. A and C
    </em>
    .
</p>
<p>
    Although the ADA and ABA Accessibility Standards have technical
requirements for ATM and fare machines    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-707">(§707</a>), and two-way
communication systems (    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-708">§708</a>) that could be
    informative, only the Section 508 requirements are referenced in this
    section of the document because they are similar, but more detailed.
</p>
<p>
    Section 508 addresses hardware accessibility with technical requirements in
    Chapter 4, including

<p>
    Although a number of provisions are specific to the accessibility needs of
    people who are blind and low vision, and cannot drive a vehicle, the
    provisions are still applicable to EV chargers purchased or used by federal
    agencies. Entities concerned only with ADA requirements may have a limited
    need for certain accessible communication features (e.g. braille
    instructions, tactilely discernible, speech output enabled, audio
    descriptions) on an EV charger, but these features can benefit all users.
    For example, speech output is helpful if there is glare on the display
    screen, and elements that are tactilely discernible are easier to find in
    the dark. By universally designing EV chargers with the needs of people
    with disabilities in mind, a better user experience can be provided for
    all.
</p>
<h2>
    EV Charger User Interface
</h2>
<p>
    Many EV chargers have an electronic user interface (UI) and are similar to
    smart parking meters or fare vending machines. Section 508 includes
    technical requirements for operable parts and reach ranges that were
    previously addressed. Section 508 also has technical requirements for
    hardware that include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Display Screens:
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o Visible from a point located 40 inches above the clear floor or ground
    space (<a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#408.2">§408.2</a>)
</p>
<p>
o Avoid bright rapid flashing (more than 3 flashes per second) (    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#408.3">§408.3</a>)
</p>
<p>
    o At least one mode with text characters in sans serif font, adjustable
text size or minimum character height of 3/16 inch (    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#402.4">§402.4</a>)
</p>
<p>
    · Speech Output Enabled: There must be an option for speech output
    providing full and independent use by individuals with vision impairments.
</p>
<p>
    o Speech output must provide all information displayed on-screen, including
    information necessary to verify the interaction and transaction with the EV
    Charger.
</p>
<p>
    o Speech output must be coordinated with information displayed on the
    display screen.
</p>
<p>
    o Speech output must allow for pausing and repeating.
</p>
<p>
o Braille instructions provided for initiating the speech-output mode (    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#402.2">§402.2</a>)
</p>
<p>
o Volume controls (    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#402.3">§402.3</a>) must be
    provided for the speech output.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Input Controls
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
o Labels on keys and for visual controls must have high contrast (    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#407.2">§407.2</a>)
</p>
<p>
    o Controls must be tactically discernible.
</p>
<p>
    o When alphabetical keys are provided, they must use a QWERTY layout.
</p>
<p>
o Where a numeric keypad is provided, it must use a standard layout (    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#407.3">§407.3</a>)
</p>
<p>
    o If keys repeat, there must be at least a 2 second delay before a key
    repeat (<a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#407.4">§407.4</a>)
</p>
<p>
    o If a timed response is required, the user must be alerted visually and by
    sound (or touch), and given the opportunity to indicate more time is needed
    (<a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#407.5">§407.5</a>)
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Keys or Cards
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o If the EV Charger requires the user to have a NFC key-chain card or other
    physical token, and that key/card requires a particular orientation for its
    use, then the key/card must provide a tactically discernible orientation.
</p>
<p>
    Visual status indicators, like the status of EV charging, should also be
discernible by sound (or touch) (    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#409-status-indicators">§409</a>
    ). Color must not be the only means of conveying information, indicating an
    action, or prompting response. Color can be used to convey meaning but
    needs to be supplemented with other visual means of conveying information
    such as the use of position, or different markings or shapes.
</p>
<p>
    Likewise, audible signals or cues should not be the only single means of
    conveying information, indicating an action, or prompting response. For
    example, an audible warning tone needs to be paired with a visual
    indicator.
</p>
<p>
    Any video content on the EV charger, such as instructional videos, should
    also meet requirements in
    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#413-closed-caption">
        §413 closed captions

    </a>
    .
</p>
<h3>
    Card readers and contactless payment systems
</h3>
<p>
    Registration and payment card readers should be compatible with contactless
    payment systems, tactically discernible, and provide visual and audible
    feedback. Tactile discernability can be achieved by slightly raising the
    contactless system reader, providing tactile labels, or by providing card
    readers capable of both inserting/swiping a card and contactless payment.
    Visual and audible feedback can be achieved with lights or display screens,
    and sounds or audio recordings.
</p>
<h3>
    Customer service/help
</h3>
<p>
    Charging station operators should provide customer service, help support,
    or other mechanisms to report outages, malfunctions, obstructed EV
    chargers, and other issues. Technical requirements for two-way voice
    communication can be found in Section 508 (
    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#412-two-way-communication">
        §412
    </a>
    ), and
    <a href="https://www.ada.gov/effective-comm.htm">
        effective communication
    </a>
    is addressed in DOJ ADA regulations. Multilingual access may also be
    required.
</p>
<p>
    Chargers can provide signs or labels with phone numbers/TTY, text message
    support, or help features integrated into the user interface. Multiple
    means of communicating audibly and visually should be provided.
</p>
<p>
    If two-way voice communication is integrated into the EV charger,
    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#412-two-way-communication">
        §412
    </a>
    of Section 508 requires:

<p>
    o This can be a handset conforming to ANSI/IEEE C63.19-2011 or TIA-1083-B.
</p>
<p>
    o For IP-based networks, this can be achieved by conforming with ITU-T
    Recommendation G.722.2 or IETF RFC 6716
</p>
<p>
    o Audio jacks are the most common approach.
</p>
<p>
    · Any caller ID feature must be both visible and audible
</p>
<p>
    · If video communication is supported, it must be of sufficient quality to
    support communication using sign language.
</p>
<p>
    · Support for bi-directional text communication, TTY functionality, or
    compatibility with legacy TTY systems.
</p>
<h2>
    Websites and Mobile Applications
</h2>
<p>
    Many EV charging stations have websites and mobile applications used to
    locate charging stations, pay for electricity, start/stop charging, and
    send notifications to users. These websites and mobile applications must
    conform to industry standards for digital accessibility. The Department of
    Justice has
    <a href="https://beta.ada.gov/resources/web-guidance/">
        guidance on web accessibility and the ADA
    </a>
    . Section 508 requires websites and mobile applications to be accessible
    and incorporates by reference the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines (    <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.0">WCAG 2.0</a>
    ).
</p>
<h2>
    Connectivity
</h2>
<p>
    Charging Networks should utilize the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) and
    provide information on accessibility in addition to the connector type,
    output power, availability, repair status, etc. Specific information on
    accessibility is more helpful than a generic designation of “accessible”.
    Specific information could include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Accessible Mobility features
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o Access aisle left side
</p>
<p>
    o Access aisle right side
</p>
<p>
    o Long charging cable (capable of reaching a vehicle charging inlet
    regardless of vehicle orientation)
</p>
<p>
    o Reserved (disabled parking placards/license plate required)
</p>
<p>
    o accessible connector (operable by people with limited hand dexterity)
</p>
<p>
    o automatic connection device
</p>
<p>
    o wireless charging
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Accessible Communication features
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o accessible user interface (section 508)
</p>
<p>
    o contactless payment
</p>
<p>
    o “Plug and Charge” compatible
</p>
<p>
    Providing pictures of accessible EV charging stations and chargers is also
    encouraged.
</p>
<p>
    The Access Board welcomes collaboration with the Open Charge Alliance to
    develop protocols for information on accessibility.
</p>
<h1>
    <a name="_Ref103327725">EV Charging Station Location within a Site</a>
</h1>
<p>
    An EV charging station must connect to an accessible route that leads to an
    accessible entrance of the building or facilities on the same site.
    Additionally, the accessible EV chargers should be on the shortest
    accessible route to the accessible entrance relative to other chargers at
    the same charging station.
</p>
<p>
    EV charging stations in parking garages must provide an accessible route
    that connects to the accessible pedestrian entrance of the parking garage.
    Additionally, a minimum vertical clearance of 98 inches should be
    maintained throughout the vehicular route to the accessible vehicle
    charging space and access aisle.
</p>
<p>
    Sites with EV charging stations as the primary purpose should include
    accessible routes that connect to any amenities on the site and, if
    provided, a sidewalk in the public right-of-way.
</p>
<h2>
    Multiple EV Charging Station Locations within a Site
</h2>
<p>
    Some large sites may have multiple EV charging station locations, and an
    accessible route should be provided at each location, similar to

<h1>
    Adding EV Charging Stations to Existing Parking Lots
</h1>
<p>
    EV charging stations added to existing sites must comply with the ADA and
    ABA requirements for alterations and additions. In alterations, compliance
    with the ADA and ABA standards is required to the maximum extent feasible
    (§202.3). For more information, please consult the Access Board’s
    <a
        href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/guides/chapter-2-alterations-and-additions/"
    >
        guide on alterations and additions
    </a>
    .
</p>
<p>
    When EV charging stations are added to an existing site, they must connect
    to an accessible route and a reasonable number of EV chargers must comply
    with
    <a
        href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/guides/chapter-3-operable-parts/#operable-parts"
    >
        §309
    </a>
    and have a clear floor or ground space and operable parts within reach
    range. Also see: Number of Accessible Chargers
</p>
<p>
    Converting accessible parking spaces to EV charging spaces is not
    recommended, especially when use will be restricted to electrical vehicle
    charging only. The ADA and ABA standards prohibit an alteration that
    decreases accessibility below the requirements for new construction
    (§202.3.1). If an existing accessible parking space is converted to an EV
    charging space, the minimum number of accessible parking spaces required by
    table <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-208_2">208.2</a> must
    be recalculated based on the total number of parking spaces provided, and
    accessible parking spaces may need to be added.
</p>
<p>
    Key considerations when adding EV chargers with accessible mobility
    features to existing parking facilities:
</p>
<p>
    · Can the chargers be connected by a compliant accessible route to the
    accessible entrance of the building or facility?
</p>
<p>
    · Is the slope and cross slope of the vehicle charging space less than
    1:48? Can the floor or ground surface be altered to achieve slopes less
    than 1:48?
</p>
<p>
    · Is there sufficient space for an 11-foot-wide, 20-foot-long vehicle space
    and 5-foot-wide access aisle?
</p>
<p>
    · Can the chargers be placed at the same level as the vehicle charging
    space? Will existing curbs and landscaping need to be removed or altered to
    place chargers at the same level as the vehicle charging space?
</p>
<p>
    · Can a clear floor or ground space positioned for a parallel approach with
    an unobstructed side reach be provided?
</p>
<p>
    · Is the clear floor or ground space firm, stable, and slip resistant?
</p>
<p>
    · If EV chargers must be mounted on a curb, are operable parts of the
    chargers still within an accessible reach range (§309) and no farther than
    10 inches and no higher than 48 inches above the clear floor or ground
    space?
</p>
<p>
    · What existing site constraints are there, and would locating chargers
    elsewhere on the site make them more accessible?
</p>
<h1>
    EV Charging Stations at Residential Facilities
</h1>
<p>
    Shared or common use EV chargers located at residential facilities provided
    by a state or local government must be accessible.
</p>
<p>
    EV chargers that are designated to specific residential units should
    provide the appropriate accessibility features. When residential facilities
    designate parking spaces to each residential unit, the parking space for
the mobility accessible unit must be an accessible parking space (    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-208_2_3_1">§208.2.3.1</a>).
    Similarly, a charger provided for a mobility accessible residential unit
    should have an electric vehicle charging space with accessible mobility
    features. A charger provided for a communication accessible residential
    unit should have an electric vehicle charger with accessible communication
    features. Upon request, additional chargers may need to be made mobility
    and/or communication accessible.
</p>
<p>
    EV chargers installed at privately-owned residential housing are not
    subject to the ADA. However, privately-owned multifamily housing may be
    subject to the Fair Housing Act (FHA) and may be required to be accessible.

<h1>
    EV Charging Stations in the Public Right-of-Way
</h1>
<p>
    EV chargers installed in the public right-of-way have unique design
    challenges due to existing sidewalks and infrastructure that may make
    installing chargers at the same level as the vehicle charging space
    technically infeasible.
</p>
<h2>
    On-Street EV Charging Stations Design
</h2>
<p>
    EV chargers installed on the sidewalk for on-street parallel parking should
    locate chargers with mobility features at the end of the block, or at the
    closest curb ramp. Section R309 of the
    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/prowag/">
        proposed Public Right-of-Way Accessibility Guidelines
    </a>
    provides design requirements for accessible on-street parking spaces, which
    can be used to design accessible charging spaces.
</p>
<p>
    Chargers can be placed on narrow sidewalks but should be oriented facing
    the sidewalk and not the street in order to ensure there is adequate clear
    floor or ground space in front of the charger to allow for a person with a
    disability to approach and operate the charger. Chargers should <u>not</u>
    be placed within the middle 50% of the sidewalk adjacent to the on-street
    parallel parking space because this design would obstruct entry to and exit
    from the vehicle.
</p>
<p>
    [Image: detectable warnings needed]
</p>
<p>
    It may be challenging to bring the charging cable out to the street to
    connect to a vehicle with a charging inlet located on the street side, so
    use of chargers at on-street parallel parking may be limited to charging
    electric vehicles with charging inlets located on the same side as the
    sidewalk. Providing chargers on both sides of one-way streets is a more
    accessible option.
</p>
<p>
    [Image: Charging stations on both sides of one-way street]
</p>
<p>
    On-street parking with wide sidewalks complying with §
    <a
        href="https://www.access-board.gov/prowag/chapter-r3-technical-requirements/#r30921-wide-sidewalks"
    >
        R309.2.1
    </a>
    have 5-foot access aisles at street level. EV chargers can be provided at
    the ends of the space or along the side up on the sidewalk. Clear floor or
    ground space at EV chargers, access aisles, and accessible routes must not
    be obstructed by bollards, curbs, trees, grass, garbage cans, etc.
    Accessible routes must not be blocked when cables are connected to
    vehicles.
</p>
<h1>
    Fleet Electric Vehicle Charging Stations
</h1>
<p>
    Fleet vehicles are cars owned by an organization (business, nonprofit
    group, or government agency). Under the ABA, fleet EV charging stations at
    facilities designed, built, altered, or leased with federal funds for
    charging organizations’ vehicles must be accessible.
</p>
<p>
    Fleet EV charging stations that serve various businesses are considered a
    place of public accommodation or commercial facility and must comply with
    the ADA Standards. Examples include a vehicle manufacturer that installs
    charging stations to serve its corporate fleet customers.
</p>
<h2>
    Employee Use of EV Chargers
</h2>
<p>
    Under <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-203_9">§203.9</a> of
    the ADA Standards, entities subject to Title II or Title III of the ADA may
    be eligible for an exception for EV charging stations provided at a
    commercial facility for charging fleet vehicles under the employee work
    area exception if charging stations are used only by employees for charging
    company/fleet vehicles. However, it is recommended that at least one EV
    charger have accessible mobility features to accommodate employees with
    disabilities because the employer may be required to provide an accessible
    EV charger if requested by an employee as a reasonable accommodation.
</p>
<p>
    If charging stations are provided for employees to charge their personal
    vehicles, the employee work area exception would not apply and EV charging
    stations must be accessible.
</p>
<p>
    EV chargers provided for specific employees to charge their personal
    vehicles should provide accessibility as needed.
</p>
<h2>
    Pull-Through EV Charging Stations Design
</h2>
<p>
    [make version without curbs?]
</p>
<p>
    As EV charging gets faster and more EVs become capable of towing, EV
    charging stations may be designed for pull-through or drive-up access,
    similar to gas stations. Pull-through EV charging stations do not need to
    mark or stripe vehicle charging spaces, but they should provide at least
    sixteen (16) feet of width for vehicle charging spaces. Charging cables
    should be able to connect to a vehicle positioned five (5) feet away.
</p>
<p>
    [Make left side of yellow box 5 feet wide, indicate 5 feet]
</p>
<p>
    Chargers with accessible mobility features must have a clear floor or
    ground space and operable parts within reach range (i.e., less than 48
    inches above the ground). Bollards aligned with the sides of EV chargers
    provide protection without obstructing use. Designing all pull-through EV
    chargers with accessible mobility features is encouraged and can be
    achieved by avoiding installation on curbs. If installation on curbs is
    required, it is recommended to create a cutout in the curb that allows the
    clear floor or ground space to be placed closer to the charger. Also see:
    <u>
        Are EV charging stations considered fuel dispensers and eligible for
        the reach range exception #2 in 308.3?
    </u>
</p>
<p>
    The use of automatic connection devices is encouraged at fleet charging
    stations, especially when chargers serve a specific vehicle make and model.
    If/when very short charging times are achieved, it may be unnecessary to
    exit the vehicle for charging.
</p>
<h1>
    Other Considerations
</h1>
<h2>
    Lighting
</h2>
<p>
    The use of lighting can be an effective way to indicate where an EV
    charging station is located within a site. Lighting can also be an
    effective way to indicate which chargers are accessible, which are in use,
    in which are not working. Lighting also helps with the operation of the
    charger, including plugging the connector into the vehicle charging inlet
    at night.
</p>
<h2>
    Shelters
</h2>
<p>
    The use of shelters to protect EV charging stations and their users from
    the elements (rain, snow/ice, and extreme sun/heat) is also recommended.
    Snow and ice can be difficult, if not impossible, for a mobility device
    user to traverse over. Plowed snow should not obstruct access to and use of
    the EV charger. Black charging cables in the extreme sun/heat can also burn
    people with limited sensation. Shelter supports, such as columns and
    pylons, should not be installed in or obstruct vehicle charging spaces or
    access aisles, and must not be installed in or obstruct clear floor or
    ground space and accessible routes.
</p>
<h2>
    Innovation
</h2>
<p>
    Innovations in automatic connection devices and wireless or inductive EV
    charging can greatly improve accessibility. This could simplify the
    charging process, including the potential to eliminate the need to access
    and operate the charger. If/when very short charging times are achieved, it
    may be unnecessary to exit the vehicle for charging.
</p>
<h1>
    Number of Accessible Chargers
</h1>
<p>
    The ADA and ABA Guidelines do not specifically address how many chargers
    must be accessible at an EV charging station. Under the ADA Standards, when
    a facility or element does not have specific scoping requirements, access
    to a “reasonable number” is required under the general prohibitions against
    discrimination in the Department of Justice (DOJ) regulations for Title II
    and Title III entities. For more information, please contact the DOJ Office
    of Civil Rights at 1-800-514-0301 or 1-800-514-0383 (TTY).
</p>
<p>
    This “reasonable number” must be accessible to and usable by people with
    disabilities, and where appropriate technical requirements for elements and
    spaces are provided in the ADA Standards, a reasonable number must meet
    those technical requirements.
</p>
<p>
    The Access Board will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rule Making that will
    solicit comments from the public on the minimum number of chargers that
    must be accessible at EV charging stations. Several approaches are
    possible, including:
</p>
<p>
· a minimum number based on the table in    <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ada/#ada-208_2">§208.2</a> for
    accessible parking spaces
</p>
<p>
    · aligning with the 2021 International Building Code (IBC) that requires 5%
</p>
<p>
    · a “use last” approach where a higher percentage have accessible mobility
    features, but are not reserved or restricted to people with disabled
    parking placards/license plates. See more on the “use last” approach
</p>
<p>
    · a hybrid approach of use last and reserved
</p>
<p>
    Issues concerning signage at accessible EV charging spaces include use of
    the ISA and how to indicate if accessible charging spaces should be
    reserved for use only by people with disabilities, or available for use by
    people without disabilities when all other chargers are being used.
</p>
<p>
    In the interim, several states have already issued accessibility
    requirements for EV charging stations. If a state or local code requires a
    minimum number of chargers be accessible, at least that minimum number must
    be provided.
</p>
<p>
    Signs displaying the ISA are not recommended at accessible EV charging
    spaces at this time, unless required by a state or local code.
</p>
<p>
    The Access Board recommends designing at least two EV charging spaces with
    accessible mobility features, and providing accessible communication
    features and operable parts at all EV chargers.
    <s>
    </s>
</p>
<p>
    This can be achieved with the following example EV charging station
    designs:
</p>
<h2>
    “Use Last” Approach to EV chargers with accessible mobility features
</h2>
<p>
    Traditionally, accessible parking spaces are identified with the
    International Symbol of Accessibility (ISA) and reserved for use only by a
    person with a disability placard or license plate. Use of the ISA at EV
    charging spaces causes confusion about whether people <u>without</u> a
    disability placard can use accessible EV charging spaces. Since EV charging
    stations usually have only a few chargers, reserving a charging space only
    for use by a person with a disability placard may result in underutilized
    chargers.
</p>
<p>
    The “use last” model would require more EV charging spaces be designed with
    accessible mobility features, but would not require that the charging
spaces be reserved exclusively for people with disability placards. People    <u>without</u> disability placards could use accessible EV charging spaces
    when all others are occupied. This would allow mobility device users to
    have more options to find a charging space with the ideal design for their
    EV, and alternative charging spaces to use if a charger is broken or
    obscured. Having alternatives is extremely important, especially if the
    next accessible charging station is very far away.
</p>
<p>
    A “use last” sign would indicate an EV charging space is accessible, but
    also direct people to use this space only when other charging spaces are
    occupied or accessibility features are needed.
</p>
<p>
    At the time of this guidance, neither Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
    Devices (MUTCD) nor any other code-setting organization has a standard for
    “use last” signs, but the Access Board has designed several examples.

    Common questions
</h1>
<h3>
    <a name="_Ref102991172">
        At charging stations that include chargers with different charging
        speeds and/or connectors, which chargers should be accessible?
    </a>
</h3>
<p>
    EV charging stations that serve the same type of vehicle and have all the
    same chargers (e.g., Tesla supercharger stations, fleet charging stations)
    should make the charger(s) with the accessible mobility features the one(s)
    on the shortest accessible route to the accessible entrance.
</p>
<p>
    EV charging stations that serve a variety of vehicles or have a variety of
    chargers (i.e., different charging levels, connectors etc.) should
    prioritize access to chargers with higher rated power output and CCS
    connectors. Networked charging stations should indicate the accessibility
    of the charging station in addition to the connector type, power output,
    and availability status so people with disabilities can accurately identify
    accessible chargers that have the connector type they need.
</p>
<h3>
    Is the International Symbol of Accessibility (ISA) required as signage for
    accessible EV charging stations with mobility features?
</h3>
<p>
    If there are state or local codes that require a certain number of
    accessible EV charging stations be designated with the International Symbol
    of Accessibility (ISA), it is recommended to meet state or local code
    requirements. In the absence of a specific requirement, the ISA is not
    currently recommended for use at EV chargers with mobility features,
    however other signs (such as the proposed “use last” sign) that indicate
    accessibility are encouraged.
</p>
<h3>
    Why should “van accessible” signs not be posted?
</h3>
<p>
    Mobility device users need an extra three (3) feet of space to maneuver
    around the EV charging space and reach the vehicle charging inlet.
    Coincidentally, this aligns with the size for a van accessible parking
    space. This is sufficient space for a mobility device user who is able to
    transfer in and out of the vehicle’s driver seat, but it may not be
    sufficient for a mobility device user that uses a ramp or lift equipped
    wheelchair accessible vehicle (van).
</p>
<p>
    As of the writing of this guide, there is no known wheelchair accessible
    battery electric vehicle and only a handful of wheelchair accessible
    plug-in hybrid vehicles that have a rear entry ramp and are not designed to
    be driven by a wheelchair user.
</p>
<p>
    Development of wheelchair accessible electric vans are in process, but the
    location of the vehicle charging inlet is not clear. Most electric vans
    place the inlet in the front of the vehicle, and it is predicted that
    accessible electric vans will provide a ramp or lift on the passenger side
    of the vehicle, although it is possible ramps may be provided at the rear
    or driver side.
</p>
<p>
    Charging inlets that are located on the same side of the vehicle as the
    ramp or lift are ideal because an access aisle would only be required on
    one side of the vehicle. A charging inlet located at the front of the
    vehicle may also work. However, charging inlets located on the opposite
    side of the vehicle ramp or lift would require even more space than the
    sixteen (16) feet for vehicle charging space and access aisle recommended
    in this technical assistance document.

<h3>
    Are EV chargers considered fuel dispensers and eligible for the reach range
    exception #2 in 308.3?
</h3>
<p>
    No. A commonly used definition of a fuel dispenser is a machine at a
    filling station that is used to pump gasoline, petrol, diesel, CNG, CGH2,
    HCNG, LPG, LH2, ethanol fuel, biofuels, such as biodiesel, kerosene, or
    other types of fuel into vehicles.
    <s>
    </s>
</p>
<p>
    Fuel dispensers were given an exception due to the mechanics of pumping
    fuel from below the ground, which required installation on existing curbs.
    EV charging stations installed in parking lots and ground surfaces where
    the electrical conduit can be located below ground should not need an
    exception to the 48-inch maximum reach range requirements. However, there
    may be times when it is technically infeasible to place electrical conduit
    belowground. For example, the installation of EV chargers in an existing
    multilevel parking garage may require installing the chargers on a platform
    above the concrete slab. In this case, it may be technically infeasible to
    comply with the 48-inch reach range requirements and reach ranges greater
    than 48 inches may be complying to the maximum extent feasible.
