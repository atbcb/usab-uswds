For more than fifty years, the Access Board has been dedicated to promoting equality for persons with disabilities through accessible design, education, and enforcement. That same passion for equal opportunity must also be a part of all that we do in the workplace. As Executive Director, I am committed to fostering a work environment that upholds the principles of fairness, equality, and respect for differences.

Providing a fair and equitable workplace requires ensuring that no employee or applicant for employment is denied equal employment opportunity (EEO) because of race, color, religion, sex, parental status, national origin, age (over 40), physical or mental disability, genetic information (including family medical history), political affiliation, military service, or retaliation for participation in protected EEO activity.

I expect all managers and supervisors to ensure that our employees and applicants are given equal opportunity in all personnel matters, including hiring, promotion, reassignment, training, career development opportunities, and awards. The Access Board provides reasonable accommodations for employees and applicants with disabilities, as well as for religious observances and practices.

Employees and applicants have the right to report incidents of discrimination or harassment without fear of retaliation. We will take swift and appropriate corrective and/or disciplinary action when any manager, supervisor, or other staff member is found to have engaged in discrimination, retaliation, or harassment – including sexual harassment – that is prohibited by Access Board policies, regardless of whether their actions also violate federal law.

Employees or applicants who believe they have been subjected to unlawful discrimination or retaliation should contact an EEO Counselor within 45 calendar days of when the alleged harm occurred. The Access Board contracts with the United States Postal Service’s National EEO Investigative Services Office for EEO services. To initiate EEO counselling, email [UspsExtCounselMedReq@usps.gov](mailto:UspsExtCounselMedReq@usps.gov). The Access Board supports the use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) to resolve EEO complaints, where appropriate, and requires management participation when ADR is approved for use.

Equal employment opportunity is not only the law, but a fundamentally sound business practice that helps the Access Board achieve its mission of promoting equality for people with disabilities. Our success in advancing full access and inclusion for all persons relies upon the contributions of every Access Board employee on a daily basis. Every employee is responsible for upholding these principles and cooperating fully in its enforcement.
