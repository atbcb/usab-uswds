The Access Board is an independent federal agency that promotes equality for people with disabilities through leadership in accessible design and the development of accessibility guidelines and standards.&nbsp;
Created in 1973 to ensure access to federally funded facilities, the Board is now a leading source of information on accessible design.&nbsp;
The Board develops and maintains design criteria for the built environment, transit vehicles, telecommunications equipment, medical diagnostic equipment, and information technology.&nbsp; It also provides technical assistance and training on these requirements and accessible design and continues to enforce accessibility standards that cover federally funded facilities.

The Board is structured to function as a coordinating body among federal agencies and directly represent the public, particularly people with disabilities.&nbsp;
Twelve of its members are representatives from most of the federal departments.&nbsp;
Thirteen others, who are appointed by the President, are members of the public, and most of them must have a disability.
