Every two months, members of the Access Board hold a meeting, which is primarily open to the public. The meetings typically span three days, with the first two days usually dedicated to committee meetings and presentations and the afternoon of the third day devoted to the agenda of the full Board. The meetings are webcast live, as well as archived. 

The next meeting of the Board will be held January 13 from 2:00 – 4:00 (ET) and will feature a presentation on conducting virtual meetings and events that are accessible to persons with disabilities. Guest speakers from the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Communications Commission will explain what makes virtual platforms accessible and highlight common access issues. They will also cover best practice recommendations and resources for platform accessibility. The public is encouraged to attend.

During the pandemic, the Board is conducting its meetings remotely using [Zoom for Government](https://zoomgov.com).

Meetings were typically held at the Board’s conference space at 1331 F Street NW, Suite 800, in downtown Washington, DC. The Board usually substitutes one of its meetings each year for a town hall forum outside Washington, DC. For the comfort of all participants and to promote a [fragrance-free](policy/ffe.html) environment, attendees are requested not to use perfume, cologne, or other fragrances.
