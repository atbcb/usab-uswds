### Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. § 794d)

The U.S. Access Board is committed to making its information and communication technologies accessible to individuals with disabilities by meeting or exceeding the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Section 508 is a federal law that requires agencies to provide individuals with disabilities access to electronic and information technology and data comparable to those who do not have disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency.  To meet this commitment, our web pages have been designed to meet or exceed the Section 508 standards and conform to the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, Level AA.

The Section 508 standards are the technical requirements and criteria that are used to measure conformance with the law.  More information on Section 508 and the technical standards can be found at [www.section508.gov](http://www.section508.gov/) and on our website.  The W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 can be found at [www.w3.org/tr/wcag20](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).

In addition to features necessary for supporting the Section 508 standards and WCAG 2.0, section headings are used to organize the content, and all videos incorporate descriptive narration in addition to open captions.  In developing our site, templates were subjected to automated and end-user testing.  All new content is subjected to expert inspection.  Template updates are checked for conformance with the Section 508 standards and WCAG 2.0 before they are deployed.

All our content is provided in HTML.  Portable Document Format (PDF) versions are available for most of our longer documents.  One popular viewer for PDF files is [Acrobat Reader](http://www.adobe.com/products/reader.html).  No endorsement is implied.

### Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. §§ 4151-57)

The Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA) requires facilities that are designed, constructed altered, or leased with federal funds to conform to accessibility standards promulgated pursuant to the ABA. The U.S. Access Board is the federal agency responsible for enforcement of the ABA and the issuance of accessibility guidelines that are subsequently adopted by agencies as ABA standards. Apart from its enforcement obligations, the Access Board is committed to ensuring that its own facilities conform to applicable accessibility standards, specifically the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS) adopted by the U.S. General Services Administration in [Federal Management Regulation §102-76.65](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/regulations/federal-management-regulation-fmr/i445613#i445698). The ABAAS is available on our website at [www.access-board.gov/aba](http://www.access-board.gov/aba). For additional information on the ABA, or to file a complaint alleging violations of applicable ABA standards, visit our website at [www.access-board.gov/enforcement](http://www.access-board.gov/enforcement) or e-mail us at <enforce@access-board.gov>.
