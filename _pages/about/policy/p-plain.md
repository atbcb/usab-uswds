## Introduction

The [Plain Writing Act (PWA)](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ274/pdf/PLAW-111publ274.pdf "Public Law 111-274 (PDF)") of 2010 requires federal agencies to write "clear Government communication that the public can understand and use."  President Obama also emphasized the importance of establishing "a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration" in his January 21, 2009, [Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/E9-1777).

The Access Board is committed to writing new documents in plain language by October 2011, using the [Federal Plain Language Guidelines](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/).

We need your help to comply with this Act!  Let us know if you have trouble understanding our documents or the pages on our website:  <jacobs@access-board.gov>.

We have assigned staff to oversee our plain language efforts:

-   Gretchen Jacobs, General Counsel, Plain Language Contact

We continue to train our employees and strengthen our oversight process.  We must use plain language in any document that:

-   is necessary for obtaining any federal government benefit or service or filing taxes;
-   provides information about any federal government benefit or service; or
-   explains to the public how to comply with a requirement that the federal government administers or enforces.

Please let us know if we haven't written a document in plain language:  <jacobs@access-board.gov>

We are required to [report]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/pwa-report.html) on our progress and compliance with the Act by July 13, 2011.
