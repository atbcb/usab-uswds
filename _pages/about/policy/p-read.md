### For our honored guest and collaborators

If you will be presenting to or with staff, or to the Access Board, your presentation materials must be fully accessible.

To learn the basics for createing accessible document, please read materials available available from [www.section508.gov/create](https://www.section508.gov/create).  These guidance materials are provide by the Accessibility Community of Practice led and coordinated by GSA and the Access Board.

For slides, the intructions available from [www.section508.gov/create/presentations](https://www.section508.gov/create/presentations/) will be impro.

Please work with your USAB staff contact to ensure that materials, well in advance of deliverable due dates, meet USAB high expectations.&nbsp; If we are not able to provide fully accessilbe versions sufficiently in advance of a training or presentation, you and your audience will have to make do without the materials, or the envent will have to be postponed.

Please provide to your USAB staff contact an example of a similar report or presentation that you regard as being accessible.  We will be looking at aspects which are not typically flagged by automatic testing.  USAB will, for examples, be considering the qualtity of alt text. 

For questions about accessible digital docuemnts, please be encouraged to contact the USAB 508 Team at <508@acceess-board.gov>.&nbsp; We are happy to educuate and work with you on accessiblity.&nbsp; USAB does not have the resources to remediate your materials.
