# {{ page.title }} of 1996 (Section 255)

The Telecommunications Act of 1996, a comprehensive law overhauling regulation of the telecommunications industry, recognizes the importance of access to telecommunications for people with disabilities in the Information Age.&nbsp;
Section 255 of the Act requires telecommunications products and services to be accessible to people with disabilities.&nbsp;
This is required to the extent access is <q>readily achievable,</q> meaning easily accomplishable, without much difficulty or expense.&nbsp;
If manufacturers cannot make their products accessible then they must design products to be compatible with adaptive equipment used by people with disabilities, where readily achievable.&nbsp;
What is <q>readily achievable</q> will be different for each manufacturer based on the costs of making products accessible or compatible and their resources.

Telecommunications products covered include:

- wired and wireless telecommunication devices, such as telephones (including pay phones and cellular phones), pagers, and fax machines;
- other products that have a telecommunication service capability, such as computers with modems; and
- equipment that carriers use to provide services, such as a phone company’s switching equipment.

The possible functions of a product are key in determining coverage. If a product can provide telecommunication services, then that portion is covered.

Manufacturers must ensure that products are "designed, developed, and fabricated to be accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities" when it is readily achievable to do so. The Access Board was given the job of developing guidelines that describe what makes telecommunications products accessible. The Access Board’s final guidelines, published in February 1998, were developed with help from an ad hoc advisory committee created by the Access Board. The Telecommunications Access Advisory Committee included product manufacturers, service providers, disability groups, and experts in communication access. The final guidelines are based on this committee’s recommendations. The Federal Communications Commission is responsible for rules and policies to enforce the law.
