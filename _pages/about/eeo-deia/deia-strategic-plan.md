### Introduction: 
The Access Board is a micro-agency that promotes equality for people with disabilities through leadership in accessible design and the development of accessibility guidelines and standards. The Access Board is structured to function as a coordinating body among federal agencies and directly represent the public, particularly people with disabilities. It has a 25-member governing board, twelve of which are representatives from most of the federal departments and thirteen of which are appointed by the President, are members of the public, and have a disability. By law, 50% of the public members are required to have a disability. But both our governing board and our staff include people with both physical and sensory disabilities.

The Access Board prides itself on its history of inclusiveness in employment. By the very nature of its mission, the Access Board is devoted to making America a more accessible and inclusive place for people with all types of disabilities. In addition, the Access Board consistently exceeds OPM and OMB’s goals for the hiring of people with disabilities for its staff. 

Its board and staff reflect a cross-section of America and include African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latin Americans, as well as those of European descent. Additionally, a  percentage of its staff are immigrants from other countries.

A person’s gender identity or sexual orientation have never been a factor in our hiring decisions, and at least 10% of staff openly identify as LGBTQ+ persons. LGBTQ+ persons occupy both managerial and line staff positions and are  represented on our board.

In summary, the Access Board is a very small agency, and its employment initiatives and goals are limited to its 28 staff positions since the selection of Board members rests with the White House. Historically, the agency has had exceptionally low turnover, oftentimes resulting in several years when the Access Board has no vacancies. In a typical year, the Access Board may recruit for one or two positions. In these recruitment moments, the agency has an exemplary record of inclusion; it is part of who we are as an agency, and we will continue this, as we go forward.
