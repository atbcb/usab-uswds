# {{ page.title }}

The "Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002" (Public Law 107-174), commonly referred to as the "No FEAR Act," aims to decrease violations of anti-discrimination laws by increasing the accountability of federal agencies for violations of those laws.  Among other things, the No FEAR Act requires federal agencies to post EEO statistics on their web sites and inform employees about their rights and remedies under applicable anti-discrimination and whistleblower laws.

## No Fear Act Notice

For more detailed information on the No Fear Act, please read the Access Board's [No Fear Act Notice]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/policy/no-fear-notice.html).

## No FEAR Act Annual Report

Section 203(a) of the No FEAR Act and OPM's implementing regulations (5 CFR Part 724) also require federal agencies to submit annual reports to specified members of Congress and other federal entities: the Access Board's [annual report]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/no-fear-report.html) for the past fiscal year.

## No Fear Act Data FY2021

Section 301 of the No FEAR Act and EEOC's implementing regulations (29 CFR Part 1614) require each federal agency to post summary statistical data about complaints of employment discrimination filed employees, former employees, and job applicants.  The Access Board's summary data for the current fiscal year (FY), as well as prior fiscal years, is as follows:
