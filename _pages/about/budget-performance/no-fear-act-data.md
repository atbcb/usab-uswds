The "Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002" (Public Law 107-174), commonly referred to as the "No FEAR Act," aims to decrease violations of anti-discrimination laws by increasing the accountability of federal agencies for violations of those laws.  Among other things, the No FEAR Act requires federal agencies to post EEO statistics on their web sites and inform employees about their rights and remedies under applicable anti-discrimination and whistleblower laws.
