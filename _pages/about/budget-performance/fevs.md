## {{ page.title }} (2024)

Each year the U.S. Access Board joins with other federal agencies in participating in the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (**FEVS**), as required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 (Public Law 108-136, November 24, 2003, 117 STAT. 1641).  Congress established a requirement for agencies to conduct an annual survey of their employees to assess employee satisfaction as well as leadership and management practices that contribute to agency performance.

### Survey Process

The 2024 FEVS asks federal employees to provide their candid opinions on all aspects of their federal employment -- their supervisors, their work experience, their agency and senior leaders.  The 2024 FEVS was administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) from May 21st to July 5, 2024.

#### Participation Rate

This year, 20 out of 26 surveys were completed at the Board -- about a 77 percent response rate.

### Overview

The survey consists of 90 questions.  Number of items identified as strengths and challenges are based on items 1-90, excluding item 16.  Item 16 is broken out separately.

Number of items identified as **Strengths** (65% positive or higher):  **52**

Number of items identified as **Challenges** (35% negative or higher): **17**
