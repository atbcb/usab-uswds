# {{ page.title }} (2018)

Each year the U.S. Access Board joins with other federal agencies in participating in the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (**FEVS**), as required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 (Public Law 108-136, November 24, 2003, 117 STAT. 1641).  Congress established a requirement for agencies to conduct an annual survey of their employees to assess employee satisfaction as well as leadership and management practices that contribute to agency performance.

## Overview

### Survey Process

The 2018 **FEVS** asks federal employees to provide their candid opinions on all aspects of their federal employment — their supervisors, their work experience, their agency and senior leaders.  The 2018 **FEVS** was administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) from May 8th to June 19, 2018.

#### Participation Rate

This year, 15 out of 26 surveys were completed at the Board — about a 58 percent response rate.

### Positives

The top five positive findings of the 2018 **FEVS** indicate that Access Board staff take pride in their work, feel that the work of the agency is important and understand the mission and priorities of the Board. Below are the U.S. Access Board’s top five positive findings:
