## Goal #4: Promote Accessibility throughout Society

The Access Board's fourth strategic goal is supported by two objectives, which are:

- Objective 4.1: Identify and address inequities in accessibility faced by underserved communities.
- Objective 4.2: Identify and work to address barriers to accessibility beyond those covered by our guidelines and standards.

### Background

Under its statutory authority, the Access Board promotes accessibility throughout all segments of society.  This work includes various activities, including, but not limited to, interacting with members of the public; holding in-person and virtual public events, such as town hall meetings, listening sessions, among others; speaking at national and international conferences; meeting with national organizations and international delegates and officials; and delivering information via its public communication channels to a wide range of stakeholders and audiences.  In FY 2023, the agency continued applying various strategies and activities to ensure that greater awareness of accessibility permeates parts of society and to listen to and collect information and comments from people with disabilities, those who serve people with disabilities, and those whose work relates to implementing accessible design.

### Summary of Key Accomplishments in FY 2023

#### Public Events and Engagement

Under the agency’s bylaws, as revised in November 2022, the Access Board holds four Board Meetings per year, one of which is usually outside the Washington, D.C. area.  In general, two of the four meetings are in- person, and the other two are conducted remotely. Board Meetings are typically held over two or three days that include both informal (i.e., closed to the public) sessions and formal (i.e., open to the public) sessions.  Some of the sessions often serve as opportunities for Board Members and staff to strategize ways to accomplish Goal #4 and to hold in-person and virtual public events to gather information on accessible design and accessibility barriers and engage with members of the public and organizations.

During FY 2023, the Governing Board met in November 2022, and in January, March, and July 2023.  In November and January, the formal sessions were open to the public through live web streams. In March, the formal session was hybrid for members of the public, with in-person attendance at the Access Board’s office building.  At the July meeting, the Access Board held a town hall meeting and reception in Baltimore, MD for members of the public to join in person and provide public comments or virtually to only listen to the event. Archival video recordings of formal sessions of Board Meetings are also posted on the Access Board’s YouTube Channel and website.

For the July Board Meeting, Board Members and staff visited Chesapeake Region Accessible Boating (CRAB) Adaptive Boating Center in Annapolis, MD on July 24, 2023 to learn about CRAB’s new accessible boathouse and marina and adaptive boating program for people with disabilities.  Over the last five years, CRAB consulted with several organizations, including the Access Board and its Accessibility Specialists who provided technical assistance in the accessible design of the facility.  During the visit, Board Members and staff were presented with an accessible sailing and boating demonstration and a tour of the facility. Informal sessions were also held on the day.

On the second day of the July Board Meeting, Board Members and staff visited the national headquarters of the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) in Baltimore, MD to tour the building and facilities, including Jacobus tenBroek Library, the gym and workout room, and the International Braille and Technology Center for the Blind, and meet with NFB leadership to learn about accessibility implementations and efforts of the organization. In the afternoon, the Access Board held a town hall meeting at NFB where members of the public had the opportunity to provide public comments.

Attendance at the July town hall meeting was 122 in-person and 90 online. 20 in-person members of the public provided public comments.  They voiced their concerns regarding accessibility and barriers with hotel rooms; transportation in Baltimore; pedestrian facilities, curb ramps, and audible signals; prescription drug container labels; accessible broadband connection in rural areas; the lack of enforcement of Section 508 and ICT; the lack of data on accessibility; and other topics.  After the town hall meeting, the Access Board held a reception and networking event to provide opportunities for members of the public to further interact and engage with Board Members and staff. This activity supported Objective 4.1, whereby Board Members and staff sought to better understand accessibility inequities, including those in underserved communities.  The Access Board will consider this information as it strategizes how its services and programs may serve the public beyond rulemaking, thus supporting Objective 4.2.

At the end of FY 2023, Board staff began preparation for the April 2024 Board Meeting in Los Angeles. This Board Meeting will primarily focus on accessibility and discrimination in the entertainment industry. In September 2023, some staff traveled to Los Angeles to meet with a range of stakeholders: disability organizations; writers, actors, and producers with disabilities; studio representatives; talent agents; representatives from the Academy of Motion Pictures, City of Los Angeles government officials; and multi- sport planning organizations. These meetings provided opportunities for the Access Board to listen to stakeholders and learn more about accessibility barriers, challenges, and efforts in the various stages of television and film production, accessibility initiatives by studio and production companies, accessible public transportation in Los Angeles, accessibility and event planning for the 2028 Olympics and the 2026 World Cup, and plans for implementing the final guidelines for public right-of-way and shared use paths in the City of Los Angeles. These week-long meetings with these stakeholders support Objective 4.1 and 4.2, and the April 2024 Board Meeting will continue in achieving these objectives through engagement with stakeholders in roundtables, panel presentations, discussions, site tours, and demonstrations.

In FY 2023, the Access Board partnered with the White House to co-host the virtual event “Disability Community Stakeholders Briefing on White House Automated Worker Surveillance and Management RFI.” The event focused on automated worker surveillance and management technologies --- including how disability community stakeholders can respond to the White House Request for Information (RFI) on these technologies. The event included presentations from White House officials in the Office of Public Engagement, Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Domestic Policy Council.  Additionally, stakeholders were provided the opportunity to ask questions. Responses in the RFI will be used to inform new policy, share relevant research data, and amplify best practices among employers, worker organizations, technology vendors, developers, and others on automated technologies that monitor and track workers.

The agency also collaborated with OPM in planning and developing OPM’s “DEIA Summit 2022: A Whole- of-Government Approach to Disability Employment,” which was held in December 2022.  The Summit focused on approaches to integrating disability employment across all areas of DEIA in the federal workforce. Over the three days, agency practitioners provided presentations, skill-builder sessions, and panel discussions on various topics, including reasonable accommodations, equity and civil rights for people with disabilities, accessibility in strategic plans and mission priorities, best practices for accessibility in built and digital workplaces, and strategic recruitment, hiring, and retention.  Board staff also presented on disability culture, accessible federal buildings and facilities, and accessibility in digital environments.

#### Presentations

To achieve Objectives 4.1 and 4.2, Access Board staff also provided presentations and engaged with stakeholders outside the context of Board Meetings and the agency’s (co-)hosted public events.  Agency staff were featured speakers or panelists at both government and industry conferences, forums, symposiums, and other public events to discuss accessible design and accessibility. Examples include, but not limited to, GSA’s 2022 Interagency Accessibility Forum, Administration for Community Living 2023 National Title VI Training & Technical Assistance Conference, M-Enabling Summit, Mid-Atlantic ADA Conference, ADA National Network Directors Meeting, and California State University, Northridge (CSUN) Annual Assistive Technology Conference.  These presentations span a range of topics in both the built environment and Section 508.

In pursuant of EOs 13175 and 13985, Board staff presented in May 2023 at IHS’s Tribal Leaders and Urban Indian Organization Leaders meeting, whose primary audience were Tribal leaders and those serving Tribal communities. Agency staff presented on the agency’s history, statutory authority, services and programs, and outreach.  In July 2023, Access Board staff also presented in person at IHS’s Office of Environmental Health and Engineering Facilities Directors quarterly meeting in Rapid City, SD. Agency staff also received a tour of the new Rapid City Health Center facility, providing technical assistance on accessibility of the facility.

Agency technical staff engaged with a wide array of federal agencies, including representatives from the NPS, FEMA, DOT’s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Federal Transit Administration, the Federal Highway Administration, Department of Labor’s ODEP, DOJ, HHS, and the Food and Drug Administration.  In addition, and as noted above, Board staff maintain partnerships and collaborations with Amtrak, state and local departments of transportation, and codes and standards organization officials, from such organizations as RESNA, ICC, and ASTM.

#### Notable Meetings

Objectives 4.1 and 4.2 were developed for alignment with EOs 13175 *Memorandum on Tribal Consultation and Strengthening Nation-to-Nation Relationships*, 13985 *Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government*, and 14035 *Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce*.  The agency has worked toward achieving the mission of EO 13175 by meeting with other federal agencies, such as Administration for Community Living, IHS, and HHS’s Indian Health Services to discuss the Access Board’s services and programs and strategize ways to build and improve relationships with Tribal communities and employees. Additionally, the agency met with community members and organizations serving Tribal members, including Disability Rights CA, National Congress of American Indians, and Southeast ADA Center, to name a few.  In continuing to achieve Objective 4.1 during FY 2024, the Access Board will seek out opportunities to connect with federal agencies focused on serving Tribal Nations and to establish relationships with Tribal communities.

Internationally, Board staff met with officials and delegates to discuss the agency’s guidelines and standards, education on and promotion of accessible design and accessibility, and U.S. laws related to accessibility.  In FY 2023, the Access Board convened with international representatives in the Department of State’s International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP), a premier professional exchange program that brings together foreign leaders and American counterparts to engage on emerging issues, policy goals, and shared interests.  These meetings involved IVLP groups with representatives from: Mongolia to discuss federal laws and standards, practices to promote accessibility throughout society, and long-term collaboration and partnership opportunities; Korea to learn about the Board’s accessibility guidelines and standards, regulations and rules, technical assistance services, and efforts to make environments accessible for people with disabilities.; Middle East and North Africa to discuss federal, state, and local laws and disability policies; Moldova to discuss sustainable cities, accessible design, Section 508, ADA, and ABA; Peru to discuss adaptive sports equipment and accessibility in higher education; and Indonesia to inclusive education for students with disabilities, integrated classrooms, disability-specific curriculum, and DEIA in the U.S.

Board technical staff also continued participating in the European eAccessibility working group to assist in developing a European standard to make ICT products and services accessible.  During June 2023, Board Executive Director and senior staff met with a European Commission delegation of three representatives to discuss ongoing work on the European Accessibility Act (EAA) and to share information and resources related to the Access Board’s work with accessibility standards and guidelines.  In July 2023, Board Executive Director presented opening remarks to an international audience of over 500 participants at the launch of the European Commission’s new Resource Center on Accessibility.

#### Public Communication

The Access Board has several external communication channels to provide information on accessibility guidelines and standards, services and programs, news updates, and accessible design resources.  These channels provide possibilities for underserved communities to be informed and supported in redressing inequities throughout society (Objective 4.1) and for all members of the public to understand barriers to accessibility beyond the Access Board's guidelines and standards (Objective 4.2).
