#### NOTE 2. FUND BALANCE WITH TREASURY

Fund Balance with Treasury account balances as of September 30, 2025 were as follows:

{% include_relative par-fy2025/par-fy2025-52-note2.html %}

No discrepancies exist between the Fund Balance reflected on the Balance Sheet and the balances in the Treasury accounts. 

Unobligated balances may include amounts that are not available for current use and are restricted to future use. 

The obligated balance not yet disbursed includes accounts payable, accrued expenses, and undelivered orders that have reduced unexpended appropriations but have not yet decreased the fund balance on hand. 

#### NOTE 3. PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT, NET

Schedule of General Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net as of September 30, 2025: 

{% include_relative par-fy2025/par-fy2025-53-note3.html %}

#### NOTE 4. LIABILITIES NOT COVERED BY BUDGETARY RESOURCES

The liabilities for the Access Board as of September 30, 2025 include liabilities not covered by budgetary resources. Congressional action is needed before budgetary resources can be provided. Although future appropriations to fund these liabilities are likely and anticipated, it is not certain that appropriations will be enacted to fund these liabilities. 

The deferred lease liability amount represents the difference at year end between the sum of monthly cash disbursements paid to date for base rent and the sum of the average monthly rent calculated based on the term of the lease. This was due to a new lease agreement entered into that had rent abatement provisions. 

{% include_relative par-fy2025/par-fy2025-54-note4.html %}

FECA and the Unemployment Insurance liabilities represent the unfunded liability for actual workers compensation claims and unemployment benefits paid on the Access Board’s behalf and payable to the DOL. 

Unfunded leave represents a liability for earned leave and is reduced when leave is taken. The balance in the accrued annual leave account is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as needed to accurately reflect the liability at current pay rates and leave balances. Accrued annual leave is paid from future funding sources and, accordingly, is reflected as a liability not covered by budgetary resources. Sick and other leave is expensed as taken. 

#### NOTE 5. OTHER LIABILITIES

Other liabilities account balances as of September 30, 2025 were as follows:

##### 2025

#### NOTE 6. LEASES

The Access Board occupies office space under a lease agreement that is accounted for as an operating lease. The lease term begins on January 1, 2022 and expires on December 31, 2036. Lease payments are increased annually based on the adjustments for operating cost and real estate tax escalations. The total operating lease expense for fiscal year 2025 was $714,757. 

Below is a schedule of future payments for the term of the lease.

#### NOTE 7. INTER-ENTITY COSTS

The Access Board recognizes certain inter-entity costs for goods and services that are received from other federal entities at no cost or at a cost less than the full cost. Certain costs of the providing entity that are not fully reimbursed are recognized as imputed cost and are offset by imputed revenue. Such imputed costs and revenues relate to employee benefits and claims to be settled by the Treasury Judgement Fund. The Access Board recognizes as inter-entity costs the amount of accrued pension and post-retirement benefit expenses for current employees. 

The assets and liabilities associated with such benefits are the responsibility of the administering agency, OPM. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025, inter-entity costs were as follows:
