# Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Justification 

This document presents the U.S. Access Board's budget justification for fiscal year (FY) 2024. The Board is requesting a total budget authority of $9,955,000 (see Appendix A).

## Introduction

The Access Board (hereinafter "the Board") was established in 1973 under section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act and is the only federal agency whose primary mission is accessibility for people with disabilities. Broadly stated, the Board has three main functions: (1) to create accessibility guidelines and standards for the built environment, transit systems, information and communication technology, and medical diagnostic equipment; (2) to provide technical assistance and training to the public on these accessibility requirements; and (3) to enforce the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, which is the law that requires that federal buildings and facilities be accessible to persons with disabilities.

With respect to the development of technical specifications for physical and digital accessibility, the Board is responsible for developing guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA), and the Communications Act for ensuring that buildings and facilities, transportation vehicles, and telecommunications equipment covered by these laws are readily accessible to and usable by people with disabilities. The Board is also responsible for developing standards under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 for accessible information and communication technology developed, procured, maintained, or used by federal agencies and establishing standards for accessible medical diagnostic equipment.

The second main function of the Board is to regularly provide technical assistance on these guidelines and standards. The Board responds to technical inquiries daily through its helpline and by email. It also issues guides, manuals, and animations to clarify provisions in the guidelines and standards and other aspects of accessible design. The Board provides training on these requirements upon request and conducts two free webinar series on physical and digital accessibility. Additionally, it manages a research program that develops technical assistance materials and provides information and data needed for rulemaking.

The Board's third main function is ensuring that federal buildings and facilities are accessible to people with disabilities by enforcing the ABA. The Board investigates submitted complaints regarding accessibility barriers encountered in federal spaces and works collaboratively with the appropriate federal agencies to ensure that violations of the ABA are remediated.

The Board's services and programs advance accessibility in buildings and facilities, transportation vehicles, medical diagnostic equipment, telecommunications equipment, and information and communication technology across the country and, ultimately, the full economic and social integration of people with disabilities into society. However, achievement of these results depends not only on the Board's activities, but also on the level of commitment and action taken by other federal agencies, State and local governments, and businesses that are required to comply with or enforce the various laws that guarantee the civil rights of people with disabilities.

### Other Duties

In addition to developing technical specifications under the ADA and ABA, the Board also completes other duties as assigned by Congress. Under the Help America Vote Act, the Board serves on the Election Assistance Commission's (EAC) Board of Advisors and Technical Guidelines Development Committee, which assist the EAC in developing voluntary guidelines for voting systems, including accessibility for people with disabilities. In addition, under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, the Board developed best practices on providing accessible information on prescription drug container labels for individuals who are blind or have low vision. Finally, in October 2018, the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act was signed into law. A provision in the law required the Board to conduct a study to determine the feasibility of in-cabin wheelchair restraint systems and, if feasible, the ways in which individuals with significant disabilities using wheelchairs, including power wheelchairs, can be accommodated with those systems.

### FY 2022-2026 Strategic Plan

The Board's FY 2022-2026 Strategic Plan includes a vision statement (A nation that is fully accessible to and inclusive of all people with disabilities) and mission statement (To advance accessibility and inclusion by developing guidelines and standards, providing technical assistance, education, enforcement, and outreach). The plan includes four goals and a stewardship objective:

-   Establish technical specifications for accessible design
-   Provide education and information on the importance and implementation of accessible design
-   Improve the accessibility of the federal government
-   Promote accessibility throughout society
-   Improve agency systems and modernize operations

The Board established long- and short-range goals and annual objectives that describe the strategies it will implement to achieve the goals. In developing the objectives and strategies, the Board is implementing the Administration's priorities to ensure the equitable provision of government services as specified by Executive Order 13985, consultation with Tribal Nations to strengthen nation-to-nation relationships as specified by Executive Order 13175, and the advancement of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the federal workplace as specified by Executive Order 14035.

## Establish Technical Specifications for Accessible Design

The Board will continue to develop and update accessibility guidelines and standards and work cooperatively with organizations that develop codes and standards affecting accessibility. It has developed the following objectives for this program area:

-   Develop and update technical specifications to achieve accessibility
-   Coordinate with standards and codes organizations to build effective industry accessibility standards
-   Engage with the public, particularly underserved communities, to inform the development of accessible design
-   Address accessibility of emerging technologies and design trends
-   Collaborate with organizations to encourage research on accessibility

### FY 2022 Results: Rulemaking

In FY 2022, the Board was active in developing new accessibility guidelines in three areas: public rights-of-way and shared use paths, self-service transaction machines and kiosks, and wheelchairs used to provide access aboard aircraft.

#### Public Rights-of-Way and Shared Use Paths

The Board is finalizing new guidelines that will address access to public rights-of-way and shared use paths, including sidewalks and streets, crosswalks, curb ramps, street furnishings, pedestrian signals, on-street parking, and other components of the public right-of-way. These guidelines will address access for pedestrians with disabilities, including those with mobility impairments and those who are blind or have low vision. They will cover various constraints unique to public rights-of-way, such as space limitations, roadway design practices, slope, and terrain.

The Board previously proposed guidelines for public rights-of-way and shared use paths based on a call for public comment and analysis of the comments received. Work on this rule was suspended in 2017 due to Executive Order 13777 *Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda*, which was rescinded in January 2021. In FY 2022, the Board continued work on this rulemaking, coordinating extensively with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department of Transportation (DOT) on the rule text.

#### Medical Diagnostic Equipment

The Board issued its accessibility standards for medical diagnostic equipment (MDE) in 2017. These standards address access to examination tables and chairs, weight scales, radiological equipment, and other equipment used by health care providers for diagnostic purposes. The standards specify that MDE transfer surfaces be adjustable across a specified range so that they can be aligned with a seat of a patient's wheelchair to facilitate transfer to the equipment. The Board proposed that transfer surfaces be adjustable from a low height of 17 inches to a high height of 25 inches based on a major study it helped sponsor on measures of people who use wheeled mobility aids. There was strong disagreement among commenters and stakeholders on what the low transfer height should be. Disability advocates supported the 17-inch minimum recommended by the anthropometric study, while MDE manufactures alleged that this height would be difficult and expensive to meet and that low height from 17 inches to 19 inches should be allowed, consistent with existing access standards and industry practice. In finalizing the MDE standards, the Board specified a temporary low transfer surface height of 17 to 19 inches pending the collection of further information and research. This provision expired in January 2022.

In February 2022, the Board issued a direct final rule extending this provision for an additional three years. Meanwhile, the Board has been working on developing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to address the low transfer height for MDE. In May 2022, the Board conducted an information meeting for the public, which focused on the results of an updated Board-sponsored study that considered the effects of various low transfer heights on individuals who use manual and powered wheelchairs. The Board received more than 100 comments in response to the information meeting.

#### Guidelines for Self-Service Transaction Machines and Kiosks

Self-service transaction machines (SSTMs) and self-service kiosks are now a common feature in places of public accommodation, government offices, and other facilities. They allow customers to conduct an expanding range of transactions and functions independently. SSTMs serve as point-of-sales machines for self-checkout in a growing number of retail facilities, grocery stores, and drug stores. SSTMs and self-service kiosks also allow customers to check-in at airports and hotels and to place orders in restaurants and retail facilities.

SSTMs and self-service kiosks have long posed accessibility barriers to people with disabilities, particularly those who are blind or have low vision. Robust speech output is necessary to provide access for users unable to see display screens. SSTMs also can pose barriers for users who are deaf or hard of hearing if lacking captioning and text equivalents for audible information. Further, these devices must be accessible to people with physical disabilities, including those who use wheelchairs and other mobility devices, have limited dexterity, or who are of short stature. In FY 2022, the Board published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) in which it sought information from the public to inform its development of these guidelines. The Board received approximately 80 comments to the ANPRM.

#### Onboard Wheelchairs

The Board is developing voluntary, advisory guidelines for aircraft onboard wheelchairs (OBWAG) used on commercial passenger aircraft to aid DOT in the department's separate regulatory initiative to improve access to air travel. DOT, as part of a negotiated rulemaking, plans to supplement its regulations implementing the Air Carrier Access Act by specifying a performance standard calling for enhanced functionality of onboard wheelchairs relative to current requirements for such devices. Currently, commercial air carriers are required on all aircraft to provide onboard wheelchairs, which facilitate the transfer of passengers with disabilities to in-cabin lavatories, since personal wheelchairs cannot be used on these aircraft. The Board's OBWAG will specify technical specifications (e.g., dimensions, features, and capabilities) for onboard wheelchairs. The Board expects its non-binding guidelines to serve as technical assistance for air carriers and manufacturers by providing an illustrative technical approach which, if followed, would provide assurance of compliance with DOT's forthcoming performance standard for onboard wheelchairs. In FY 2022, the Board and DOT conducted a virtual public meeting to obtain additional information from the public needed to finalize their respective rules.

### FY 2023 Planned Activities: Rulemaking

The Board is working on the following regulatory initiatives in FY 2023.

#### Public Rights-of-Way and Shared Use Paths

The Board plans to complete the final rule package in the second quarter of FY 2023 and submit the package to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review, prior to publication.

#### Self-Service Transaction Machines and Kiosks

In September 2022, the Board issuedan ANPRM to address access to SSTMs and self-service kiosks. The ANPRM sought feedback from the public on the planned approach to supplementing the ADA and ABA Accessibility Standards to include scoping and technical requirements for these devices so that they are fully accessible to all users, including those who are blind or have low vision, who are deaf or hard of hearing, who have a physical disability, or who are of small stature. This regulatory initiative, once complete, will provide technical specifications for the accessibility of point-of-sale machines, self-checkout machines, check-in kiosks, and other SSTMs and scoping for built-in self-service transaction machines that fall under the Board's regulatory jurisdiction. The Board intends to issue an NPRM on accessible SSTMs and self-service kiosks in November 2023 for FY 2024.

#### Medical Diagnostic Equipment

The Board developed an NPRM establishing a low transfer height for MDE that it voted to send to OMB for review in January 2023. Following publication of the NPRM and the public comment period, the Board will evaluate the comments received and develop a final rule that it expects to publish in FY 2024.

#### Electric Vehicle Charging Stations

Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations are becoming commonplace with the rising production and use of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, there are nearly 50,000 public EV charging stations with almost 127,000 charging ports across the country. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which President Biden signed into law in November 2021, allocates $7.5 billion to build out a national network of 500,000 EV chargers to accelerate the adoption of EVs. In July 2022, the Board issued a technical assistance document on the accessibility of EV charging stations and is now developing an NPRM to include accessibility guidelines for EV charging stations as a supplement to the ADA and ABA Accessibility Standards. In the last quarter of FY 2022, the Board entered into an interagency agreement with DOT's Volpe Center to conduct a preliminary regulatory impact analysis (PRIA) to accompany the NPRM, and Board staff are drafting the proposed rule, which is currently scheduled for publication in July 2023.

#### ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Transportation Vehicles

The Board is undertaking rulemaking to revise requirements for rail vehicles in the ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Transportation Vehicles. These requirements have not been modified or updated since they were issued in 1991. In February 2020, the Board published an ANPRM to initiate the regulatory process for potentially updating its accessibility guidelines for rail vehicles. The Board received over 200 public comments in response to this notice. Publication of an NPRM is currently scheduled for November 2023.

### FY 2024 Objectives: Rulemaking

In FY 2024, the Board aims to publish the following rulemaking documents:

-   A final rule on MDE specifications for the low height of transfer surfaces
-   A final rule on accessibility of self-service transaction machines and self-service kiosks
-   A final rule on the accessibility of EV charging stations
-   A final rule revising the guidelines for accessible rail vehicles in the ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Transportation Vehicles

### FY 2022 Results: Codes and Standards

#### Adoption of Board Guidelines as Enforceable Standards

For the Board's accessibility guidelines to become enforceable, other federal agencies must generally complete rulemaking to adopt the guidelines as standards. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Department of Defense (DOD), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) use the Board's guidelines to develop enforceable standards under the ABA. DOJ and DOT use the Board's guidelines to develop enforceable standards under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. USPS, GSA, DOD, DOJ, and DOT have adopted the Board's guidelines as enforceable standards. HUD has not acted yet, although HUD has announced, in its Fall 2022 Semi-Annual Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions, its intent to adopt the Board's ABA Accessibility Guidelines as standards applicable to HUD facilities subject to the ABA.

#### Voluntary Consensus Standards

The Board's long-range goal is to take a leadership role in the development of codes and standards for accessibility. The Board works with model codes organizations and voluntary consensus standards groups that develop and periodically revise codes and standards affecting accessibility. The Board has voting membership in several codes and standards organizations and monitors or is actively involved in the development or revision of dozens of other codes and standards affecting accessibility.

The Board believes this goal enhances its credibility as a knowledgeable source of information regarding technical aspects of accessibility. Additionally, by working cooperatively with model codes organizations and voluntary consensus standards groups, federal and private codes and standards will become more similar, or harmonized, and the Board will be more alert to non-federal influences affecting its constituencies. Harmonization between federal and private requirements will make it more likely that buildings and facilities will be accessible, thus reducing the necessity for complaints and litigation.

Exemplifying the Board's collaboration with voluntary consensus standards groups is its membership in the ICC A117.1 Standard for Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities Committee. The ICC A117.1 Standard, which is a key counterpart to the Board's ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines, is referenced by the International Building Code (IBC). In FY 2022, the Board participated in task groups organized by the A117 Committee to develop provisions on adult changing tables and assisted-use toilet and bathing facilities for the A117.1 Standard. This work also advanced proposals for corresponding requirements in the IBC. Through this work, the Board is able to collaborate and provide input on revisions to the A117.1 and IBC that improve accessibility.

Two governing Board members serve as members of the Technical Guidelines Development Committee and Board of Advisors, which provide recommendations to the EAC under the Help America Vote Act. The Board continues to work with the EAC in the development of updated Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG). The VVSG, which were first published in 2005, significantly increased security requirements for voting systems and expanded access, including opportunities for individuals with disabilities to vote privately and independently. It provides a set of specifications and requirements against which voting systems can be tested to determine if the systems meet required standards. The guidelines are voluntary, and States can adopt them entirely or in part. In 2021, the EAC adopted version 2.0 of the VVSG.

While the Board was in the process of updating accessibility requirements for information and communication technology (ICT), a similar process began in Europe to create the first European ICT accessibility standards. Beginning in 2005, the Board and the European Commission began to work closely to harmonize ICT accessibility requirements. In early 2014, the three European standardization organizations---European Telecommunications Standards Institute, European Committee for Standardization, and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization---published the first European specifications on e-accessibility for public ICT procurements, EN 301 549, "Accessibility requirements suitable for public procurement of ICT products and services in Europe."

The current European standard is largely harmonized with the Board's January 2017 final rule that updated the Board's ICT Standards and Guidelines. Since publication of the Board's final rule with a European Joint Working Group on eAccessibility, the Board has been working to further harmonize the U.S. and European standards and will continue that effort in 2022 and beyond.

Some of the codes and standards groups that the Board works with include: the International Code Council (ICC) Consensus Committee on Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities, ICC (ASC A117); American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) A18 Platform Lift and Stairway Chair Lift Committee; National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), Disability Access Review Advisory Committee; National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard; World Wide Web Consortium Accessibility Guidelines Working Group; ASTM (formerly known as American Society for Testing and Materials) Committee on Playground Surfacing Systems; Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America (RESNA) Standards Committee on Cognitive Accessibility and Assistive Technology for Air Travel; Transportation Research Board; National Cooperative Highway Research Program; National Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices; Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Disability Advisory Committee; the Chief Information Officers Council's Accessibility Community of Practice; and many others.

The Board is also a member of the Interagency Committee on Standards Policy, which is the group that is responsible for overseeing the use of standards by federal agencies in accordance with the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act.

### FY 2023 Planned Activities: Codes and Standards

The Board will continue to work with private sector codes and standards organizations to harmonize the Board's guidelines with model codes and standards. For example, in FY 2023, Board staff continues to attend and participate in regular meetings of the A117 Committee to consider proposals for the future edition of the A117.1 Standard for Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities. The Board will also continue to work with the EAC on future updates to the VVSG and with the European Joint Working Group on eAccessibility to further harmonize U.S. and European standards.

### FY 2024 Objectives: Codes and Standards

The Board will continue to collaborate with the EAC and the European Joint Working Group on eAccessibility and will continue its efforts to harmonize its guidelines with model codes and standards, including the ICC A117.1 Standard for Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities.

## Provide Education and Information on the Importance and Implementation of Accessible Design

The Board provides training and technical assistance on accessibility guidelines and standards to a wide variety of people and entities, including architects, builders, designers, technology companies, manufacturers, people with disabilities, State and local governments, and federal agencies. The Board's long-range goal is to be known as a leading source of information on accessible design.

The Board has the following objectives in this program area:

-   Provide training on accessible design and the Board's guidelines and standards
-   Provide technical assistance on implementation of accessibility guidelines and standards
-   Create guides, manuals, and animations to promote understanding of accessible design
-   Use stakeholders' feedback to improve information services
-   Conduct and sponsor research on accessible design and technical innovations

The Board's technical assistance program has four components:

-   Responding to technical inquiries.  The Board responds to 4,000 -- 5,000 inquiries each year via the agency's technical assistance helpline and email accounts. Customers want accurate, reliable, and timely advice, and the Board's Accessibility Specialists dedicate extensive time in answering questions and engaging with stakeholders.
-   Developing and disseminating guides, manuals, and other publications.  The Board maintains numerous publications on accessibility issues. These publications range from manuals on the Board's guidelines and standards, to animations and online guides, to the ADA and ABA Accessibility Standards.
-   Providing training.  The Board conducts training on its guidelines and standards through  in-person trainings and via online webinars. Since the pandemic, the Board has transitioned to providing more training virtually through remote platforms instead of in-person. In addition, the Board conducts two free webinar series: AccessibilityOnline Series and Section 508 Best Practices Series. The AccessibilityOnline series provides sessions each month on different topics concerning accessible design and the Board's accessibility guidelines and standards on the built environment. The Section 508 Best Practices series includes bi-monthly webinars that discuss how agencies can implement accessible ICT in accordance with the Board's 508 Standards. Attendees of these sessions can earn continuing education credits.
-   Maintaining the Board's website.  The Board's website ([www.access-board.gov]({{ site.baseurl}})) is a valuable resource for providing information to the public. Customers can view and/or download the Board's publications, the accessibility guidelines and standards, and animations from the website. The animations illustrate how accessible features are used by individuals with disabilities and add improved the rationale for the guidelines and standards.

As the Board develops new guidelines for public rights-of-way and shared use paths, self-service transaction machines and kiosks, updated guidelines for rail vehicles, and EV charging stations,  there will be increased demands for technical assistance from existing and new customer groups. The Board maintains informal partnerships with organizations such as the National Association of ADA Coordinators and their network of ten regional ADA centers that post links and archive Board webinars for further marketing and distribution across the nation. The Board also provides refresher training to the Directors and organization staff.

### FY 2022 Results

In FY 2022, the Board released its technical bulletins on various plumbed elements and spaces covered in the ADA and ABA Standards, including lavatories and sinks, washers and dryers, and saunas and steam rooms. It also completed work on an accessible signage technical bulletin for ADA and ABA standards. Each bulletin clarifies common sources of confusion, answers frequently asked questions, and offers recommendations for best practices. Examples of compliant facilities and elements are included to illustrate how various requirements can be met.  The Board also published a technical assistance document on accessible EV charging stations.

Board staff conducted over 104 training sessions, reaching more than 21,300 participants during FY 2022 on its guidelines and standards via in-person, online meeting platforms, and webinars. In addition, the Board continues presenting its very successful monthly webinar series through a partnership with the National Network of ADA Centers. The Board conducts sessions monthly on built environment issues and bi-monthly on ICT issues (in conjunction with the Chief Information Officers Council Accessibility Community of Practice). Each 90-minute webinar provides opportunities for participants to earn continuing education credits (CEUs) for a fee, but general attendance is free.

In FY 2022, as part of its monthly AccessibilityOnline series, the Board conducted the following well-attended webinars.

-   Accessible Means of Egress
-   Architectural Trends in Accessible Design
-   The Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) Compliant Investigation Process and Corrective Action Plan Procedure
-   Accessible Signage
-   Accessible Swimming Pools and Spas
-   Accessibility in the Federal Workspace
-   Accessible Golf and Miniature Golf Facilities
-   Accessible Residential Facilities
-   Recreational Boating and Fishing facilities
-   Common Sources for Confusion in the ADA and ABA Standards

The Section 508 Best Practices webinars included the following topics.

-   Section 508 -- A Celebration of Twenty Years
-   The Wonderful World of Audio Description in 2022 -- Getting Started, Discovering What is Out There, Enjoying the Process and the Product
-   Creating an Accessible Documents Program
-   Intro to Website Accessibility
-   Section 508 Q&A
-   Accessibility in the Federal Workspace
-   Accessible Data Visualization
-   ICT Guidance for Accessible DEIA Plans

During FY 2022, the Board participated in the OPM Accessibility Summit planning meetings and prepared over four accessibility workshops to present during the FY 2023 event.

In FY 2022, the Board's Accessibility Specialists responded to over 4,500 technical assistance requests to the public through the help line or by email. The Board conducted a total of 73 virtual training sessions and webinars. Through these sessions, the Board provided training to over 21,000 people, which represents a similar number to those trained the previous year. The Board has begun resuming in-person trainings, as the pandemic eases.

The Board uses its website to disseminate the Board's guidelines, standards, and answers to frequently asked questions so more customers can easily obtain information in accessible formats. In FY 2022, there were approximately 839,371 visitors to the site, about 1.2 million user sessions, and over 2.3 million page views.

### FY 2023 Planned Activities

#### Online Guide, Webinars, and Website

The Board will continue developing materials for the online guide to the ADA and ABA standards. Technical guides covering chapter 7 of the standards are in progress. These guides will address communication elements and features, including fire alarm systems, telephones, detectable warnings, assistive listening systems, ATMs and fare machines, and two-way communication systems. In addition, staff are updating Chapter 10 guides to improve the graphics and to reflect the adoption of the standards by the DOJ. Future installments to the guides will be released and announced through Board email subscribers as they become available.

The Board continues to offer its very successful webinar series for the built environment and on Section 508. In FY 2023, Board webinars will reflect the updated guides and most recent rulemaking activities.

Technical Assistance and Research Projects

The following research and technical assistance activities are planned for FY 2023.

-   Draft technical assistance document on accessible autonomous vehicles
-   Regulatory assessment for the Public Rights-of-Way Accessibility Guidelines final rule
-   Complete preliminary regulatory impact analysis for the Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Supplemental Rule
-   Contract for the preliminary regulatory impact analysis of the Self-Service Transaction Machines Supplemental Rule

### FY 2024 Objectives

The Board will continue to improve its website, including releasing additional modules for the web-based guide for the ADA and ABA standards.

The following research and technical assistance projects are planned for FY 2024:

-   Regulatory assessment for updated ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Rail Vehicles
-   Regulatory assessment for supplementary guidelines on self-service transaction machines

## Improve the Accessibility of the Federal Government

The Board is committed to improving the accessibility of the federal government and has the following objectives in this program area:

-   Improve the accessibility of federal buildings and facilities through enhanced awareness and robust enforcement of the Architectural Barriers Act
-   Improve accessibility of federal information and communication technology through collaboration with other federal agencies
-   Be a model employer of persons with disabilities

The Board was established in 1973 with the primary purpose of enforcing the ABA. The ABA requires that most buildings designed, constructed, altered, or leased by the federal government and certain other federally financed facilities be accessible to people with disabilities. The Board enforces the ABA by investigating complaints received from members of the public or federal employees.

Complaints received concern post offices, national parks, military facilities, veterans' hospitals, courthouses, and a variety of other facilities. When the Board has jurisdiction and finds that the applicable accessibility standards were not followed, it requires a corrective action plan and monitors the case until the barrier is removed. Even when the Board does not have jurisdiction, or no violation is found, it attempts to negotiate voluntary barrier removal. For covered buildings where corrective action is required, the Board has a 100% compliance rate.

In resolving complaints, the Board has learned that most violations are not intentional. When violations are found, it is usually because the people responsible for designing buildings, reviewing plans, and on-site construction were not well-informed of the accessibility standards or how to apply them. As such, the Board takes proactive measures to work with federal agencies, such as conducting training sessions, to ensure that, before starting a new project or executing a new lease, they understand and comply with their ABA obligations.

While the Board continues to successfully execute its ABA-related mandates, its responsibilities have expanded significantly during its nearly 50-year history. One such duty includes ensuring that ICT is accessible to people with disabilities, as required by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act for federal agencies to only develop, procure, maintain, and use ICT that is accessible.

In all of its work, the Board seeks to remove barriers to equity and inclusion for, and increase the dignity and respect of, individuals with disabilities. But the Board acknowledges that these outward, public-facing endeavors cannot succeed if it does not also focus its efforts internally, on its own employees. As such, the Board continuously strives to be a model employer of people with disabilities in all phases of the employment life cycle---from recruitment and hiring to advancement and retention. The Board actively recruits individuals with disabilities and other underserved communities into vacant positions. In FY 2023, the Board is launching an internal staff training program to generate broader understanding and targeted outreach to underserved communities

### FY 2022 Results: ABA Enforcement and Awareness

In FY 2022, the Board received 241 ABA complaints and closed 197 complaints.

Of the 197 ABA cases closed this year, 45 cases (about 23%) were closed after the federal agency (or other facility owner/leaseholder) took corrective action to remedy building elements or features determined by our investigative findings to be ABA violations under the applicable accessibility standard. This figure represents an 8.4% increase compared to cases closed in the prior fiscal year (FY 2021) following corrective action. The increase is partly explained by the fact that three USPS facilities each had two ABA complaints with similar allegations lodged against them, and corrective action projects completed in FY 2022 at those three facilities accounted for the closure of six complaints total. Also, four longstanding complaints concerning facilities of the GSA (mentioned below) that had timelines for corrective action impacted by pandemic-related delays in FY 2021 were all able to be resolved in FY 2022.

In brief, the ABA closed cases this year that resulted in corrective action can be assorted into three broad categories by facility type:

-   Defense-related and Veterans Facilities: The Board successfully resolved seven ABA complaints against DOD and Veterans Affairs (VA), including cases relating to the Family Camp at Travis Air Force Base, California (mentioned above); the Roudebush VA Medical Center in Indianapolis, Indiana; and Naval Station Norfolk.
-   Post Offices: The Board successfully resolved 31 ABA complaints relating to USPS facilities, with major remedial work completed for post offices in Cave Junction, Oregon; Winnsboro, South Carolina; Seattle, Washington (two locations); Hickory, North Carolina; and Keller, Texas.
-   Other ABA-Covered Facilities: The Board also successfully resolved five other ABA complaints relating to facilities owned or leased by GSA (the Region 6 Headquarters Building in Kansas City, Missouri; the Peckham Federal Building in San Jose, California; the Denver Federal Center in Lakewood, Colorado; and Social Security Administration offices in Culpeper, Virginia, and Reading, Pennsylvania). In addition, the Board resolved complaints against the U.S. Forest Service (mentioned above) and the Thomas Day House in Milton, North Carolina---where the Board had jurisdiction since a prior renovation of the historic site used federal grant funds from the Department of the Interior (DOI), and where the governing board installed an entrance ramp in response to the ABA complaint.

The balance of ABA cases closed this year---or 77%---were concluded for a range of technical or administrative reasons.

Nine complaints (or 4.6%) were closed because the Board determined, after conducting an investigation, that it lacked jurisdiction (because, for example, the building was built prior to 1968 and thus not covered by the ABA) and 13 complaints (or 6.6%) were closed because the Board determined that the complaint allegations did not constitute ABA violations (because, for example, a building inspection revealed that the element at issue did in fact meet the minimum scoping requirements or technical specifications in the ABA standards).

72 complaint closures (or 36.5%) involved referring complainants to other federal agencies because the Board determined (without launching an investigation) that it lacked ABA jurisdiction over the matters raised in the complaint. In FY 2022, the Board mainly referred complainants to DOJ (complaints related to ADA-covered state or local facilities or places of public accommodation) and HUD (claims relating to apartment buildings covered by the Fair Housing Act).

(Note: for many years the Board's practice for referrals was to simply provide complainants with information on how to file their non-ABA complaints with the appropriate agency. But, in an effort to lessen the burden on these individuals, in FY 2022 the Board began implementing a process to forward the complaint directly to the correct agency, after obtaining complainants' permission to disclose their identities. The Board is expanding this implementation in FY 2023 and establishing it as a standard operating procedure.)

Finally, 58 ABA complaints (or 29.4%) were closed in FY 2022 for administrative reasons.

But it is important to note a change in the data going forward. Through FY 2022, the Board reported on the cases it closed for administrative reasons, which ranged from being unable to act on unintelligible or "spam" filings to lacking sufficient detail to discern the nature of the allegations or to allow enforcement staff to contact the complainant to gather additional/clarifying information. Beginning with FY 2023, the Board will no longer report such complaints. The new software for the Complaint Tracking System, discussed below, allows the Board to refrain from assigning a complaint number to unactionable complaints, thus not counting them in totals for complaints received and closed. This will give a more accurate reflection of the substantive ABA enforcement work the Board does. Therefore, the Board expects the numbers of total complaints received and closed in FY 2023 and FY 2024 to decrease from earlier years---not because of a decrease in the cases received but rather due to the change in procedure. The data for the first half of FY 2023 confirms that anticipated trend.

Appendix C below provides final data for ABA cases closed in FY 2021 and FY 2022, including reasons for case closure.

The success of the Board's complaint resolutions, and its ABA enforcement program as a whole, is due to close collaboration with other agencies, particularly those the ABA charges with setting accessibility standards based on the minimum guidelines the Board writes: GSA, USPS, DOD, and HUD. The Board engages in at least monthly contact with the individuals at these agencies responsible for facility accessibility, where it not only principally discusses active complaints and the steps agencies are taking to resolve them, but also discusses opportunities for expanding the reach of technical assistance and training services to all other agency employees involved with facility design, construction, maintenance, and leasing. The Board's aim in this regard is to ensure that ABA-covered facilities comply with all applicable accessibility standards.

The Board continues to respond quickly to all new complaints. Most complainants now file their complaints through its website using its Online ABA Complaint Form, while others e-mail complaints to the Board via a dedicated ABA enforcement email address. Some complaints are referred to the Board by the DOJ, with whom individuals may have filed a complaint about a facility they thought was covered by the ADA (enforced by DOJ) but which is actually covered by the ABA.

Regardless of method of submission, the Board contacts complainants to acknowledge receipt of their complaint and communicates with them regularly thereafter to keep them apprised of the progress in its investigation. Upon completing investigations, the Board always gives complainants an opportunity to comment on the Board's determinations and actions that have been taken before closing complaints. At the end of the complaint process, the Board seeks feedback through an online Customer Satisfaction Survey. Because the survey is voluntary, and because individuals responding are permitted to do so anonymously, the Board uses this data for anecdotal purposes and, where applicable, to improve the efficiency of its ABA enforcement program.

In order to ensure greater public awareness of its work, the Board continues to post annually a list on its website describing all the ABA corrective actions taken that year to remediate accessibility barriers in federal buildings and facilities. But in the Board's equity assessment required by Executive Order 13985, *Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government* (January 2021), the Board acknowledged a previously unmet need to focus its ABA outreach and enforcement on underserved communities, where members of those communities have higher incidences of disability and for whom the accessibility of federal buildings and facilities is essential. Aside from expanding outreach to underserved communities, the Board is developing a strategy of collaboration with sister agencies with oversight of facilities in those communities, such as DOI (including the Bureaus of Indian Affairs, Indian Education, and Trust Fund Administration), the Department of Health and Human Services (including the Indian Health Service), USPS, and GSA, which both own or lease tens of thousands of facilities across the country, most of which are public facing.

Likewise, pursuant to its obligations under Executive Order 14035 *Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce* (June 2021), the Board is developing a strategy of collaboration with the OMB, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and other agencies to ensure that all federal employees know about the ABA and the fact that they can file ABA complaints with the Board. In addition, the Board's strategy will help other agencies comply with their obligations pursuant to this Executive Order to ensure that their facilities not only comply with the ABA and related standards but also go beyond those legal requirements to maximize the accessibility of agency workplaces and reduce the need for reasonable accommodations. In FY 2022, the Board published a document to assist agencies in identifying and advancing facility accessibility.

The Board will coordinate with HUD as necessary to assist in HUD's adoption of ABAAG as its accessibility standards under the ABA. HUD has announced that it will issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking toward that end in June 2023: [www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202210&RIN=2529-AB04](https://reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202210&RIN=2529-AB04).

Finally, the Board has procured licenses for a new software solution and contracted with an implementation provider for its Complaint Tracking System. The new system is less expensive and more efficient than the legacy system and will allow the Board to further expedite complaint handling.

### FY 2023 Planned Activities: ABA Enforcement and Awareness

The Board will continue to investigate complaints under the ABA. Based on complaint receipts and closures to date in the current fiscal year, it expects to receive 160 new complaints, and close 150. Of the 150, the Board expects to close 60 following investigations resulting in the completion of corrective action, with an additional 30 investigations resulting in determinations that it lacked jurisdiction or that the complaint allegations did not amount to a violation of the standards. The Board expects to refer complainants to other federal agencies in 63 matters when it is clear---prior to the commencing of an investigation---that the allegations relate to a disability-related or civil rights law other than the ABA.

As noted in the preceding section "FY 2022 Results: ABA Enforcement and Awareness," beginning with FY 2023 the Board is no longer including spam, unintelligible, or otherwise unactionable complaints in our totals of complaints received and closed. As set out in Appendix C, the Board will not be closing any complaints for administrative reasons in FY 2023 or FY 2024.

The Board will continue to provide periodic updates to complainants on the status of their complaints. It will continue to refine program processes based on performance measures developed earlier to better increase efficiency in the operation of the compliance and enforcement program. It will also consider the input it receives from its Customer Satisfaction Survey to assist in these efforts.

Consistent with Executive Order 14035, the Board will begin executing its plan to work with federal agencies across the government (via coordination with the OMB, OPM, and GSA) to ensure that they know about and fully understand their minimum obligations under the ABA and ways they can go beyond those requirements so that the federal government can be a model of facility accessibility and the need for reasonable accommodations can be reduced. The Board will publicize recommendations and resources that agencies can consider as they develop and execute their DEIA Strategic Plans required by the Executive Order. The Board will also take proactive measures to ensure that federal employees know about the ABA and how they can file ABA complaints with the Board in the event they encounter accessibility barriers in their workplaces.

The Board also plans to produce an overview video on the ABA that covers its jurisdiction, what facilities are likely or unlikely to be covered, and how complaints are investigated and to publish a year-end news story on its website that summarizes the ABA cases closed during the fiscal year.

Consistent with Executive Order 13985 and its Equity Action Plan, the Board will begin executing its strategies for working with members of underserved communities with higher incidences of disability to expand its outreach and for working with federal agencies that operate facilities where in-person services are provided to members of those communities (e.g., Bureau of Indian Affairs, Indian Health Service, USPS, and Social Security Administration) to ensure that ABA-covered facilities are accessible.

The Board will support HUD, as necessary, as it proceeds with implementation of its updated ABA accessibility standards.

### FY 2024 Objectives: ABA Enforcement and Awareness

Aside from its efforts under Executive Order 14035, the Board will continue focusing on the accessibility of facilities in underserved communities, consistent with Executive Order 13985 and its Equity Action Plan.

The Board will continue to provide effective and responsible customer service and increase efficiency in the operation of the compliance and enforcement program.

### FY 2022 Results: Accessible Federal Information and Communication Technology

The Access Board provides authoritative interpretations of its Section 508 standards and collaborates extensively with GSA in providing technical assistance to agencies. Together, they develop and post resources to the [Section508.gov](https://section508.gov) website which serves as the federal government's central repository of accessible ICT information and resources.

During FY 2022, the Board provided extensive training to other federal agencies to promote accessible ICT through the bi-monthly best practices webinars, individualized agency trainings, presentations at agency accessibility events, and via the annual Interagency Accessibility Forum (IAAF), a conference for federal agencies.

The Board co-leads the development of the ICT Testing Baseline Portfolio which will establish minimum requirements for test processes to ensure that all Section 508 requirements are evaluated accurately and consistently. Agencies can use the baselines to determine if their test processes produce accurate Section 508 conformance test results. The portfolio is comprised of four different areas: a Baseline for Web and an alignment framework, development of a Baseline for Documents, and reporting tools. The Baseline for Web was released in FY 2021 and the Board worked on updates during FY22. A new update is expected to be released in FY 2023.

The Board also co-facilitates the World Wide Web Consortium's (w3C) Web Accessibility Initiative's (WAI) Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Task Force. This Task Force develops and maintains a repository of test rules to promote a unified interpretation of the Web Conformance Accessibility Guideline requirements among different web accessibility test tools and methodologies. The Board also contributes Trusted Tester implementation results for the ACT rules.

### FY 2023 Planned Activities: Accessible Federal Information and Communication Technology

The Board is undertaking initiatives in partnership with other federal agencies to promote and advance ICT accessibility throughout the federal sector. During FY 2023, the Board will continue contributing content to the [Section508.gov](https://section508.gov) website, the federal government's centralized resource on procuring, developing and maintaining accessible information and communication technology. Board staff will further leverage their roles in co-chairing two subcommittees of the Chief Information Officer Council (CIOC) Accessibility Community of Practice. Further development is underway to establish a framework and tools for which agencies can assess and monitor web site accessibility conformance with the Section 508 standards. In addition, the Board intends to refresh the bi-monthly Section 508 best practices webinars and will co-sponsor the annual IAAF that educates federal employees on the latest developments in accessible information and communication technology.

As a leader serving on the ICT Testing Baseline (for federal government) and the ACT (international), the Board will work toward ensuring agreement with what the accessibility standards require and how to test for conformance.

In FY 2023, the Board will continue providing webinars, training, and guidance to federal agencies on any updated requirements and newer provisions of the 508 Standards.

### FY 2024 Objectives: Accessible Federal Information and Communication Technology

The Board plans to continue its collaboration with GSA on promoting ICT accessibility in FY 2024. As part of this effort, it will provide guidance to federal agencies on their annual update of the DEIA strategic plans to further advance the accessibility of ICT used by employees. The Board will continue to support any new OMB directives to agencies in complying with the Section 508 accessibility standards and to support new agency reporting requirements.

### FY 2022 Results: Model Employer of Persons with Disabilities

In accordance with the objectives of the DEIA Executive Order, the Board continues to exceed OPM and OMB's goals for the hiring of people with disabilities. The Board prides itself on its history of inclusiveness in employment. By the very nature of its mission, the Board is devoted to making America a more accessible and inclusive place for people with all types of disabilities.

New performance standards were drafted for all staff that focus on employee career development and the cultivation of an inclusive, constructive work environment that is committed to Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) policies and principles and is based on transparent communication, mutual trust, and respect.

Additionally, the Access Board procured services for a leadership training program focusing on creating an inclusive culture.

### FY 2023 Planned Activities: Model Employer of Persons with Disabilities

As a micro agency, the Board and its employment initiatives and goals are limited to its 30 staff positions, since the selection of governing Board members rests with the White House. Historically, the agency has had exceptionally low turnover, oftentimes resulting in several years when the Board has had no vacancies. In a typical year, the Board may recruit for one or two positions. In these recruitment moments, the agency has an exemplary record of inclusion; it is part of who the Board is as an agency, and the Board will continue this as it moves forward.

To further this goal for FY 2023, the Board is continuing its efforts to ensure that leaders at all levels promote the vision for DEIA by taking actions to increase diversity and equity in the workforce and maintain an inclusive and accessible workplace. Board staff will attend a mandatory workshop entitled "The Power of Inclusive Teams." This workshop is designed to demonstrate how to foster an inclusive environment that improves team performance by addressing diversity-related concerns consistent with organizational values and diversity-related policies. Additionally, the Board is improving the consistency of desired outcomes by strengthening policies and procedures and utilizing technology.

### FY 2024 Objectives: Model Employer of Persons with Disabilities

The Board plans to continue its efforts and practices for hiring people with disabilities in FY 2024. As part of this effort, it will recruit, hire, and develop a high-performing workforce that reflects the diversity of communities the Board serves by optimizing outreach.

## Promote Accessibility Throughout Society

As noted above, the Board's technical assistance and ABA enforcement program contribute to promoting accessibility in various segments of society. The Board also promotes accessibility in the public sphere in other ways, apprising various audiences about accessible design, disability-related issues, and its programs and services. The Board has two primary objectives in this program area:

-   Identify and address inequities in accessibility faced by underserved communities
-   Identify and work to address barriers to accessibility beyond those covered by the Board's guidelines and standards

The Board approaches these objectives with four strategies:

-   To sustain and increase public awareness of the Board and its activities
-   To hold events where the Board can hear from members of the public
-   To research and learn more about communities impacted by accessibility barriers and disability-related concerns
-   To strengthen relationships with Access Board stakeholders

### FY 2022 Results

#### Access Board Meetings

In FY 2022, the Board held five formal business meetings with its 25-member governing board. Three of the five meetings were conducted virtually and the other two were held in person---one at the Board's office in Washington D.C. and the other in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. These meetings provide opportunities for the Board to discuss business, plan actions to implement its mission and activities, and strategize ways to, among other things, educate the public on accessibility.

#### Virtual Public Events

Since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, the Board has initiated virtual public events to engage with and hear from members of the public and organizations. In FY 2022, Board staff continued to organize and manage these public events by creating an accessible experience for attendees. These public events were free to members of the public, who were also able to pose questions and provide comments. These public events included 200 -- 900 attendees for each event.

##### Designing for Inclusion: Architectural Trends and Social Justice (November 2021)

This event focused on current trends in architectural design for toilet rooms, lavatories, adult changing tables, self-service transaction machines, wayfinding, dining surfaces and tables, and accessible routes, including those that have emerged in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Presenters highlighted aspects of those trends that advance equity and inclusion and discussed design alternatives to trends that are not fully accessible to all.

##### Public Meeting Regarding Onboard Wheelchair on Single-Aisle Aircraft (December 2021)

DOT and the Board held a virtual public meeting to collect information on wheelchairs that are specifically designed for use on aircraft during flights. The agencies will use this information to finalize performance standards and advisory guidelines for aircraft onboard wheelchairs. The public were invited to provide information orally or in writing at the meeting.

##### Equity in Healthcare for People with Disabilities (January 2022)

This virtual event focused on healthcare and accessibility. It featured panel presentations on accessibility standards, research, and resources related to inclusive medical equipment, healthcare facility design, and information technology, and communication devices and systems. Members of the public were able to pose questions to the presenters during the event.

##### Public Information Meeting on Low-Height Specification for MDE Transfer Surfaces (May 2022)

This virtual public information meeting focused on accessible MDE and the adjustability of transfer surfaces for patients who use wheelchairs. The Board is hosting this meeting to gather information on the minimum heights that MDE with transfer surfaces, including examination tables and chairs and diagnostic imaging medical equipment with tables, can be adjusted to accommodate the broadest range of users. Members of the public were provided an opportunity to comment orally and in writing.

#### In-Person Public Events

In FY 2022, the Board renewed holding some in-person events, beginning in September 2022 with its out-of-town meeting in Philadelphia. The three-day Philadelphia Board meeting served as an opportunity for the Board to examine innovations in accessible design undertaken around the Philadelphia region, provide expertise on accessible design and accessibility trainings to local designers and disability advocates, meet with people with disabilities from underserved communities, and visit with several disability organizations and local government officials.

##### Philadelphia Town Hall Meeting (September 2022)

This event was held at Liberty Resources, Inc., Philadelphia's Center for Independent Living. The Board heard from members of the public who testified about a range of concerns, including accessibility barriers at a local post office; accessibility issues in the public right-of-way; lack of services for adults with developmental disabilities; lack of communication access at medical appointments, job interviews, and on public transportation; and unavailability of accessible at-home COVID tests. The Board also heard from City of Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney and Amy Nieves, Executive Director of Philadelphia Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities. Following the town hall meeting, the Board and members of the public continued conversations on accessible design and disability issues at the networking reception.

###### Staff Presentations

In FY 2022, Board staff presented at many national, regional, and state conferences, forums, and events to advance accessibility and inclusion for people with disabilities. Board staff presented on various topics, such as the President's Executive Orders, emerging technology and trends, information and communication technology resources, accessibility in the federal workplace, accessible voting and polling places, and the guidelines and standards under the ADA, ABA, and Section 508, to name a few.

###### Communication with the Public

In addition to the Board's services (technical assistance and trainings), the Board has several communication channels to engage with and serve the public. The Board has a free e-subscription for the purpose of distributing its news releases. In FY 2022, the Board had its largest yearly growth of subscribers: from 42,946 to 53,119 subscribers (+26.76%). Compared to previous years, the Board also distributed more email bulletins to subscribers in FY 2022, totaling 4,178,884 (+76.67% from FY 2021).

The Board continues to use social media platforms to amplify its messages, mission, technical assistance, events, and public engagement. Since 2015, the Board has used Twitter for its primary social media account, but in 2021, the Board expanded its social media channels by creating two new accounts: Facebook page and LinkedIn organization page. At the end of FY 2022, the Board's Twitter account had 2,361 followers, LinkedIn account had 1,852 followers, and Facebook page had 370 followers. All three of these accounts saw significant increases in followers and engagement. The Board's YouTube Channel provides technical information via its popular animations, videos, and recordings from the Board's public events.

Board staff also frequently meet and interview with journalists at media outlets to discuss accessibility guidelines and standards, rulemaking, and best design practices in various areas of the built environment and Section 508.

###### Executive Orders

The Board has also dedicated more staff time and resources to fulfilling the Biden-Harris Administration's Executive Orders 13985 *Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government*, 13175 *Tribal Consultation and Strengthening Nation-to-Nation Relationships*, and 14035 *Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce*. As an agency dedicated to accessible design for people with disabilities, all of the agency's activities in some way advance equity and remove barriers for underserved individuals; however, the agency has dedicated more staff time and resources to ensuring that people with disabilities in underserved communities and Tribal Nations are informed about and acquire its services. The following actions provide some highlights of accomplishments in FY 2022:

-   Advised OPM's Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the planning of OPM's inaugural DEIA Summit 2022: A Whole-of-Government Approach to Disability Employment.
-   Created a set of DEIA recommendations and resources to aid federal agencies in drafting the portions of their strategic plans required under Executive Order 14035 dealing with accessibility.
-   Developed a DEIA Strategic Plan 2022 to advance and embed diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility throughout its workforce. The plan includes four goals to foster a culture that exemplifies teamwork, embraces innovation, and values diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility to achieve mission excellence.
-   Developed a project to translate ABA and ADA Standards and Guidelines and agency technical assistance materials into Spanish and contracted with an organization to translate other major Board documents.
-   Delivered presentations to other federal agencies and departments that focus on serving or working with American Indian and Alaska Natives populations;
-   Met with staff and representatives of other federal agencies to discuss opportunities and collaboration to reach out to Tribal Nations.
-   Met with non-profit organizations focused on accessibility and people with disabilities.

### FY 2023 Planned Activities

Thus far in FY 2023, the Board continues to promote awareness of its work, programs, and service. The Board also plans to execute the following activities in FY 2023:

-   Press Conference on PROWAG (TBD). With anticipation of the publication of the PROWAG final rule, the Board will hold a press conference with media attendance to announce these accessibility guidelines.
-   50-year Agency Anniversary and 33-year ADA Anniversary Commemoration (July 2023). In commemoration of the agency's 50-year anniversary and the ADA's 33-year anniversary, the Board will host a town hall meeting to hear from members of the public about accessibility issues and barriers in their communities and lives.
-   Implement a Communication and Outreach Strategy and Plan (June 2023). The Board is currently working on a research project that will inform its efforts to augment communication and outreach to the public and communities.

#### Outreach

The Board will continue to undertake initiatives to enhance equity for historically underserved communities. As part of this effort, the Board will include in its *Communication and Outreach Strategy and Plan* a particular focus on outreach activities that provide information on services and programs to underserved communities with high rates of disability and professionals serving those communities. The Board will also strive to establish and strengthen relationships with other federal agencies that own or lease federal facilities where in-person services are provided to underserved communities with high rates of disability. As noted above, it will also work with federal agencies to establish ABA compliance strategies aimed at proactively ensuring the accessibility of buildings and facilities in underserved communities through accessibility assessments and the remediation of architectural barriers.

At the beginning of FY 2023, the Board contracted with the marketing firm The Georgetown Firm, which is a research-based solutions management consulting firm. The Georgetown Firm has a marketing team that has worked for many similar programs and offices within the federal government, creating strategies and plans to reach stakeholders tied to an agency's mission and the consumers of an agency's content. As a small agency, the Board often faces the issue of low visibility among the public and in the federal sector and a lack of resources (i.e., FTE, labor, and time) to maximize its interfacing with stakeholders and audiences. The contract work resolves this issue by contributing to and enhancing the Board's efforts to raise its public profile, serve the public with services and programs, expand its stakeholders and audiences, and reach underserved populations.

### FY 2024 Objectives

The Board aims to strengthen relationships with existing stakeholders and audiences by continuing to reach out to professional associations, trade groups, federal agencies, and other organizations whose stakeholders can benefit from its services and programs. Additionally, the Board will continue to build relationships with other federal agencies who serve underserved communities, especially Tribal Nations. One of the goals of this work is to listen to and learn about accessibility and barriers in Tribal communities through attendance at Tribal conferences and gatherings, presentations to Tribal leadership and officials, and hosting listening sessions.

The Board also aims to acquire new stakeholders and audiences, specifically those in underserved communities, through outreach, promotional materials development, and more Spanish-translated agency documents. These activities will be included in the Board's *Communication and Outreach Strategy and Plan* and developed based on the recommendations in The Georgetown Firm's Marketing Plan.

## Improve Agency Systems and Modernize Operations

For FY 2022 through FY 2026, the Board has added a stewardship objective to its strategic plan to improve agency systems and modernize operations. The Board has set the following objectives:

-   Use data and technology to enhance operations and services
-   Use tools and internal systems to consolidate and retain agency knowledge
-   Update agency policies, procedures, and administrative regulations

The Modernizing Government Technology Act delivers a clear mandate to federal agencies to look for ways to increase efficiency and effectiveness and improve service to the public. The Board has a requirement to employ centralized identity management systems for agency users that can be integrated into applications and common platforms. Information Technology (IT) resources are critical in support of the Board's strategic objective to improve agency systems and modernize operations. This objective includes using data and technology to enhance operations and services, using tools and internal systems to consolidate and retain agency knowledge, and updating agency policies, procedures, and administrative regulations. The overall goal of the Board, in accordance with recent and ongoing IT mandates, is to create a common environment for enterprise platform standards, processes, and governance, modernize legacy agency equipment, and secure and enhance the IT infrastructure. The IT appropriation provides resources for IT security enhancement modernization efforts, continued adoption of cloud-based computing solutions, consolidation of infrastructure and networks, and the modernization of legacy IT systems and applications. This funding level will also support the maintenance and enhancement of foundational capabilities that facilitate cloud migration and increase functionality.
