## Goal #2: Provide education and information on the importance and implementation of accessible design

The Access Board's second strategic goal is supported by four objectives, which are:

- Objective 2.1: Provide training on accessible design.
- Objective 2.2: Provide technical assistance on implementation of accessibility guidelines and standards.
- Objective 2.3: Create educational materials to promote understanding of accessible design.
- Objective 2.4: Use stakeholders' feedback to improve our information services.

### Background

The Access Board provides technical assistance (TA) to the public on its guidelines and standards and on other aspects of accessible design through a TA hotline, published guidance, and webinars and training. The agency responds to thousands of TA inquiries each year via phone and e-mail. In recent years, the Access Board's website has also become a go-to resource on accessible design. Users of the website can, among other things, view the Access Board's accessibility guidelines and standards, as well as downloadable animations illustrating the rationale behind the guidelines and standards and showing how accessible features are used by individuals with disabilities. All published materials are downloadable in accessible formats. Collectively, the Access Board's TA services play a critical role in assisting design professionals, governmental jurisdictions, people with disabilities, and other stakeholders understand and apply accessible design requirements.

### Summary of Key Accomplishments in FY 2022

#### Technical Assistance

As in prior years, the Access Board's TA services proved to be one of the agency's signature ways to serve the public, enabling the agency to achieve Objectives 2.1 and 2.2. In FY 2022, over 4,582 TA inquiries were managed. Inquiries are fielded through the Board's TA phone line and via e-mail. Most inquiries help members of the public in their understanding of technical requirements and how to apply the accessibility guidelines and standards to their specific situations.

To ensure consistent and accurate staff responses to accessibility questions, the Access Board developed a knowledge management system (KMS) to collect and store information and guidance generated in its provision of TA. This internal, centralized repository enables staff to document and categorize questions received and the specific answers by staff. The KMS supports Access Board staff in easily retrieving and providing consistent assistance to members of the public. Information housed in the KMS includes hyper-linked cross-references to agency guidance relevant to a given provision or topic, responses to past TA inquiries, and notations about accessibility or design issues that may warrant future attention by the agency (e.g., the development of educational and training materials). The Access Board expects this critical tool to pay great dividends by enhancing the clarity and consistency of the technical assistance it provides to the public daily.

#### TA Guidance

As part of its TA program, the agency develops various educational materials (Objective 2.3) to help explain different aspects of its guidelines under the ADA, ABA, and other laws. The agency's Guidance Documents and TA Documents review application of relevant existing ADA and ABA Accessibility Standards and non-mandatory recommendations and best practices to improve access to a site, building, facility, space, element, or service. Access Board staff also produce informative animations that help design professionals understand the reason and method of application of the requirements in the ADA and ABA Accessibility Standards. The agency's website provides a complete list of its Guidance Documents (including animations and videos) at [www.access-board.gov/guidance.html]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidance.html) and its TA Documents at [www.access-board.gov/tad]({{ site.baseurl }}/tad).

In FY 2022, the Access Board published a total of four guides/technical bulletin as part of its Guidance Documents collection and one TA Document. Each publication includes extensive graphics to illustrate accessibility requirements and best practices for accessible design. The five publications are:

##### Guides/Technical Bulletins

1. Lavatories and Sinks
2. Washing Machines and Clothes Dryers
3. Saunas and Steam Rooms
4. Signs

##### Technical Assistance Documents

1. Design Recommendations for Accessible Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (discussed in greater detail under Goal #1, above).

#### Other Technical Assistance, Resources, and Public Communication

The Access Board achieves Objective 2.3 through other efforts, such as relationship-building, resources, and public communication. As in prior years, the Access Board cultivates a solid partnership with Amtrak to ensure that accessibility improvements continue as rail cars are updated. In FY 2022, as part of its technical assistance efforts, Access Board technical staff travelled several times to Philadelphia to roll through and review the hard mock-up of Amtrak's new rail cars that will replace the existing 50-year-old Am-Fleet rail cars. During those visits, Access Board staff identified several design improvements to meet Amtrak's accessibility obligations and to improve the disabled riders' experience.

In FY 2022, the Access Board continued refining and updating the agency website, which serves as the national resource on ADA and ABA accessible design and federal accessibility guidelines and standards. Through this site, the Access Board provides updates to federal agencies and members of the public on rulemaking, research, ABA enforcement, training, technical assistance, and other programs.

In FY 2022, the agency's website was expanded to include the ICT Testing Baseline for Web subdomain,[^ii]) a notable expansion of guidance materials available for Section 508 and ICT accessibility. The principal idea behind the ICT Testing Baseline is that federal agencies should have a consistent approach to testing so that if one agency methodically audits a commercial product, and rates a product as being 508 conformant, then another agency can have confidence in those test results without having to perform its own audit. The Baseline identifies the minimum requirements of any test process used to determine conformance of web content with Section 508 and the WCAG 2.0 Conformance Requirements (i.e., Success Criteria Level A and Level AA). The ICT Testing Baseline is a Best Practice of the Federal CIOC ACOP, and federal agencies are encouraged to utilize the Baseline in their efforts to test web content for Section 508 conformance. Access Board staff lead the work in close collaboration with the General Services Administration and other participants of ACOP.

In FY 2022, the Access Board also continued to employ other communication strategies to promote and publicize its technical assistance and training services, as well as circulate educational materials, to a broader audience. The agency uses an e-mail subscription system to promote awareness of its work, services, and programs by delivering information to over 53,000 subscribers. These subscribers can sign up for any, or all, of the agency's seven subscription topics on accessibility (Access Board News, Buildings and Sites, Health Care, Information and Communication Technology, Recreation and Outdoor Areas, Streets and Sidewalks, and Transportation). At the end of FY 2022, the total subscriptions are 158,000, which is on average 2.98 subscriptions per unique subscriber. The Access Board also has a Twitter handle (@AccessBoard) with over 2,300 followers and a YouTube channel that has over 3,100 subscribers and features videos on the work of the agency and its animations on accessibility. In the second half of FY 2021, the Access Board created agency accounts on Facebook and LinkedIn, and FY 2022 provided the first full year for the Access Board to use these communication channels to distribute information and educational materials, engage with the public, and raise the profile of the agency. Currently, the agency's Facebook profile has over 380 followers and LinkedIn has over 1,905 followers.

#### Agency-Sponsored Trainings and Webinars

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Access Board transitioned from in-person to online remote, web-based training sessions. Beginning in Spring 2022, the Access Board re-initiated in-person trainings on a limited basis. In FY 2022, the agency sponsored and/or conducted 105 webinars and trainings, reaching more than 21,000 participants. These figures represent a 23% increase over the total number of webinars and trainings provided in FY 2021 (85). This increase is attributed to the Access Board's successful transition from in-person to distance learning and remote training, and a robust public affairs campaign to promote more frequently the agency's work through social media, email bulletins, and other communication channels.

The Access Board continued two successful free webinar series that disseminate technical information on accessibility standards and guidelines to a broad range of audiences. Participants are provided the option to join live or later view on-demand via archived recordings posted on the web. Currently, the Access Board hosts a catalog of 135 archived webinars. Additionally, there are 15 self-paced, archived webinars that offer continuing education credits (CEUs).

The webinars target two accessibility populations. The first series addresses accessible design relating to the built environment. Sessions focus on the ADA and ABA Accessibility Standards and provide guidance on a range of facility types and review common sources of confusion. These monthly 90-minute sessions are offered in cooperation with the National Network of ADA Centers. All webinars include video remote interpreting (VRI) and real-time captioning. CEUs were available to participants, if desired. Overall, in FY 2022, over 7,300 people attended the sessions in this webinar series.

The second webinar series delivers Section 508 best practices, in partnership with the Federal CIOC ACOP. This series is a primary pipeline to ensuring that federal agencies obtain key knowledge to buy and maintain accessible ICT, including federal web sites and other electronic materials, as required by Section 508. The Access Board solicits presenters from across federal service and facilitates the delivery of best practices and educational sessions to support agencies in better implementing the Section 508 accessibility requirements. Bi-monthly 90-minute sessions are offered, and all webinars include VRI and real-time captioning. Recent topics include the accessibility of social media, accessible electronic documents, audio description, and ICT guidance for implementing accessibility into DEIA plans in the federal workforce. During FY 2022, this webinar series reached almost 3,000 participants.
