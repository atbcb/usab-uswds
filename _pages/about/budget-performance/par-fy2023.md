{% include_relative par-fy2022-51-note1.md %}

#### NOTE 2. FUND BALANCE WITH TREASURY

Fund Balance with Treasury account balances as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, are shown below.

{% include_relative par-fy2022-52-note2.html %}

No discrepancies exist between the Fund Balance reflected on the Balance Sheet and the balances in the Treasury accounts.

The available unobligated fund balances represent the current-period amount available for obligation or commitment.&nbsp;
At the start of the next fiscal year, this amount will become part of the unavailable balance as described in the following paragraph.

The unavailable unobligated fund balances represent the amount of appropriations for which the period of availability for obligation has expired.&nbsp;
These balances are available for upward adjustments of obligations incurred only during the period for which the appropriation was available for obligation or for paying claims attributable to the appropriations.

The obligated balance not yet disbursed includes accounts payable, accrued expenses, and undelivered orders that have reduced unexpended appropriations but have not yet decreased the fund balance on hand.

#### NOTE 3. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET

Accounts receivable balances as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were as follows.

{% include_relative par-fy2022-53-note3.html %}

The accounts receivable is primarily made up of employee receivables and debt.

Historical experience has indicated that the majority of the receivables are collectible.  There are no material uncollectible accounts as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.

#### NOTE 4. GENERAL PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET

Schedule of General Property, Plant and Equipment, Net as of September 30, 2022:

{% include_relative par-fy2022-54-note4a.html %}

Schedule of General Property, Plant and Equipment, Net as of September 30, 2021.

{% include_relative par-fy2022-55-note4b.html %}

#### NOTE 5. LIABILITIES NOT COVERED BY BUDGETARY RESOURCES

The liabilities for Access Board as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, include liabilities not covered by budgetary resources.  Congressional action is needed before budgetary resources can be provided.  Although future appropriations to fund these liabilities are likely and anticipated, it is not certain that appropriations will be enacted to fund these liabilities.

The deferrred lease liability amount represents the difference at year end between the sum of monthly cash disbursments paind to date for base rent and the sum of the average monthly rent calculated based on the term of the lease.  This was due to a new lease agreement entered into that had rent abatement provisions.

{% include_relative par-fy2022-56-note5.html %}

FECA and the Unemployment Insurance liabilities represent the unfunded liability for actual workers compensation claims and unemployment benefits paid on Access Board's name behalf and payable to the DOL.

Unfunded leave represents a liability for earned leave and is reduced when leave is taken.  The balance in the accrued annual leave account is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as needed to accurately reflect the liability at current pay rates and leave balances.  Accrued annual leave is paid from future funding sources and, accordingly, is reflected as a liability not covered by budgetary resources.  Sick and other leave is expensed as taken.

#### NOTE 6. OTHER LIABILITIES

Other liabilities account balances as of September 30, 2022 were as follows:
