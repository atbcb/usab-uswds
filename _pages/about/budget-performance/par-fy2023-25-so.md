## Stewardship Objective: Improve Agency Systems and Modernize Operations

The Access Board's stewardship objective/goal is supported by three objectives, which are:

- Objective 5.1: Use data and technology to enhance operations and services.
- Objective 5.2: Use tools and internal systems to consolidate and retain agency knowledge.
- Objective 5.3: Update agency policies, procedures, and administrative regulations.

### Background

The Modernizing Government Technology Act delivers a clear mandate to federal agencies to look for ways to increase efficiency and effectiveness and improve service to the public. The Access Board has a requirement to employ centralized identity management systems for agency users that can be integrated into applications and common platforms. IT resources are critical in support of the Access Board's strategic objective to improve agency systems and modernize operations. The overall goal of the Access Board, in accordance with recent and ongoing IT mandates, is to create a common environment for enterprise platform standards, processes, and governance, modernize legacy agency equipment, and secure and enhance the IT infrastructure.

### Summary of Key Accomplishments in FY 2022

#### IT Modernization

In FY 2022, the agency continued its IT modernization efforts with the adoption of new technologies, tools, and best practices in order to support its Stewardship Objective. The Access Board continues to move toward total migration to the cloud environment versus maintaining on-premises hardware within a local network. The agency's Cisco VOIP phone system was successfully migrated to a cloud-based Microsoft Teams phone system. Cloud-based communications are internet-based communications that exist beyond hardware designed for telephones. This permits the agency to present a single identity to its customers. Every employee, whether working in the office, on travel conducting accessibility training, or working from a remote location, can make and receive calls using their agency telephone number.

In accordance with federal government mandates on maintaining secure IT systems, the Access Board implemented two-factor authentication for all cloud-based applications. Standard online security procedures requiring only passwords to verify authentication are vulnerable to security breaches. Two-factor authentication is a technique that adds an extra level of security. Along with the username/password combination, users are asked to verify their identity with a factor that only they have access to, such as a numeric code sent via text or a fingerprint. This makes it extremely difficult for individuals to hack Access Board systems and limits the extent of damage hackers could cause. Two-factor authentication has also provided the agency with the capability to pair its agency smartphones with its passwords to permit staff to safely work using the phones while protecting access to online accounts.

#### Updated Policies

During FY 2022, the Access Board established and/or updated policies to govern appropriate procedures for the use of e-mail and for records management. The e-mail policy was constructed to ensure that all users of the Access Board's e-mail system are aware of the agency's policies on its appropriate use. The policy informs the user of procedures to ensure consistent availability, efficient performance, and secure access to the agency's e-mail system for all users. E-mail is an integral part of doing business at the Access Board, enabling more rapid delivery of vital programs, services, and information. Increasing dependence on and use of e-mail results in a compelling need to protect these critical resources through constant and improved monitoring, administration, user training, and awareness.

The National Archives and Records Administration's (NARA) initiative provides a government-wide policy framework and guidance for electronic records management. In accordance with NARA's policy and guidance, the Access Board drafted its Electronic Records Management policy. The policy outlines activities required for systematically controlling the creation, distribution, use, maintenance, and disposition of recorded information maintained as evidence of agency activities.

Additionally, to support Objective 5.3, the Access Board revised numerous human resources policies that were out-of-date and created some new policies where none had previously existed. Policies issued in FY 2022 include those governing the performance appraisal of Senior Executive Service (SES), Senior Level (SL), and General Schedule (GS) employees; awards for SES, SL, and GS employees; and the agency's telework policy. In August 2022, the agency sent revised procedures for handling reasonable accommodation requests from employees with disabilities to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for review pursuant to EO 13164, which requires all federal agencies to have written reasonable accommodation procedures. The Access Board has continued to update the agency's COVID Safety Plan and to make employees aware in a timely manner of changes in response to recommendations from public health officials and directives from the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force. By the end of FY 2022, revised procedures for handling equal employment opportunity complaints and an anti-harassment policy (to replace an interim policy in effect since 2020) were substantially completed and were approved as final in October 2022.

Finally, the Access Board has been working to enhance and update its Privacy program to include working closely with the IT group to enhance procedures for privacy incidents and breaches, including issuing a Breach Response Policy, Training and Awareness Policy, and a Breach Response Procedure, all of which were implemented in October 2022.
