## Stewardship Objective: Improve Agency Systems and Modernize Operations

The Access Board's stewardship objective/goal is supported by three objectives, which are:

- Objective 5.1: Use data and technology to enhance operations and services.
- Objective 5.2: Use tools and internal systems to consolidate and retain agency knowledge.
- Objective 5.3: Update agency policies, procedures, and administrative regulations.

### Background

The Modernizing Government Technology Act delivers a clear mandate to federal agencies to look for ways to increase efficiency and effectiveness and improve service to the public. The Access Board has a requirement to employ centralized identity management systems for agency users that can be integrated into applications and common platforms. IT resources are critical in support of the Access Board's strategic objective to improve agency systems and modernize operations. The overall goal of the Access Board, in accordance with recent and ongoing IT mandates, is to create a common environment for enterprise platform standards, processes, and governance, modernize legacy agency equipment, and secure and enhance the IT infrastructure.

### Summary of Key Accomplishments in FY 2024

#### IT Modernization

In FY 2024, the Access Board continued working toward IT modernization efforts with the implementation of several new technologies and tools to support its Stewardship Objectives. Key accomplishments include the initiation of the single sign-on through okta as part of the Zero Trust strategies for Identity Management and related efforts. In FY 2024, the Board also completed the migration to Palo Alto security devices and has identified and implemented an alternate identity management solution.

The modernization efforts were extended to mobile devices such as cell phones, etc., for safeguarding and securing devices through applications such as “lookout”. As part of the FY 2024 modernization efforts, all agency computers were upgraded to utilize the latest technologies such as touch panels and the most recent, stable, and secure operating system. Furthermore, the new devices are now managed through “Mobile Device Management”, which allows for remote management of computers, including imaging, locking, wiping, and updating of software and hardware to address any cybersecurity related vulnerabilities.

The Access Board has made great progress to fully modernize mobile device management. The agency’s device management is a critical component of the Board’s security strategy. It helps ensure that mobile devices are secure, updated, and compliant with agency policies, with the goal of protecting the network and data from unauthorized access. Implementations, such as Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), full enablement of Personal Identity Verification (PIV), and Zero Trust architecture, are progressing toward completion.

The Board has also migrated all cyber policies to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-53 Rev 5. The cyber team reviews Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M) to track assorted items around risk management. Another key IT initiative included commencement of migration of on-prem servers to the Azure Cloud; this major effort will result in overall reduced costs associated with supporting physical data centers while increasing flexibility, scalability, accessibility, security, and faster deployment times. The transition of Continuous Diagnostic Monitoring (CDM) has brought greater value to the Access Board’s ability to maintain a strong cybersecurity posture. CDM has helped in many areas, including asset management, risk management, vulnerability management, Agency-Wide Adaptive Risk Enumeration (AWARE) scores, and FISMA metrics. The Access Board can now track Binding Operational Directives and Emergency Directives more efficiently while staying up to date with the latest cybersecurity threats. 
Additionally, the Access Board successfully achieved the Authorization to Operate (ATO) for General Support Systems (GSS); this milestone allows the agency to meet the cybersecurity requirements to effectively interact with other federal agencies. All these efforts support Objectives 5.1 and 5.2.

#### Updated Policies

To support Objective 5.3, the Access Board developed new and updated existing policies in FY 2024.  There were two new policies issued in FY 2024 and four that will be implemented early 2025.

- In February 2024, the Access Board issued new procedures for providing personal assistance services (PAS), as required by 29 C.F.R. §1614.203(d)(5), a regulation implementing Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 501), as amended. 29 U.S.C. § 791.
- In September 2024, the Access Board issued a revised Privacy by Design policy.  This policy outlines the requirements associated with the inclusion of privacy by design in ongoing project initiatives at the Access Board.

Finally, the Access Board has been working to enhance and update its privacy program to include working closely with the IT staff to enhance procedures for privacy incidents and breaches, including issuing a Breach Response Policy, Training and Awareness Policy, and a Breach Response Procedure, all of which were implemented in previous year but are going through regular review and updates to ensure continuity of best practices.
