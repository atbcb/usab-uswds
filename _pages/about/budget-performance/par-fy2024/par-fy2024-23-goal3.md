## Goal #3: Improve the Accessibility of the Federal Government

The Access Board's third strategic goal is supported by three objectives, which are:

- Objective 3.1: Improve the accessibility of federal buildings and facilities through enhanced awareness and robust enforcement of the Architectural Barriers Act.
- Objective 3.2: Improve accessibility of federal information and communication technology through collaboration with other federal agencies.
- Objective 3.3: Be a model employer of persons with disabilities.

### Background

Improving the accessibility of the federal government is a foundational pillar of the Access Board's mission.  The agency was established by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to be the sole agency responsible for the enforcement of the ABA.  he ABA requires most buildings designed, constructed, altered, or leased by the federal government --- along with certain other federally-financed facilities --- to be accessible to, and usable by, people with disabilities.  The agency's ABA compliance and enforcement program processes and investigates complaints and, when violations are found, works with the appropriate federal agency or facility owner/leaseholder to remedy these barriers.  In any given year, the Access Board receives ABA complaints concerning a wide range of federal buildings and facilities, such as office buildings, service centers, post offices, national parks, military facilities, Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers, and courthouses.  Enforcement program staff also work proactively with federal agencies and others to ensure that relevant officials at headquarters, regional and field offices, and local sites have a working knowledge of their accessibility obligations.  The Access Board has cultivated productive working relationships with senior leaders at its sister federal agencies, particularly those that own, manage, or lease federal properties or see frequent ABA complaints.

While the Access Board continues to successfully execute its ABA-related mandates, its responsibilities have expanded significantly during its nearly 50-year history.  One such duty includes ensuring that ICT is accessible to and usable by peole with disabilities, as required under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Federal agencies must develop, procure, maintain, and use ICT that is accessible. This ensures equal access to federal employment for people with disabilities and reduces the need for agencies to undertake individual accommodations. In addition, this ensures that members of the public who are individuals with disabilities will have access to government information and services. The Access Board is undertaking initiatives in partnership with other federal agencies to promote and advance ICT accessibility throughout the federal sector.

In all of its work, the Access Board seeks to remove barriers to equity and inclusion for, and increase the dignity and respect of, individuals with disabilities.  But the Access Board acknowledges that these outward, public-facing endeavors cannot succeed if it does not also focus its efforts on its own employees.  As such, the Access Board continuously strives to be a model employer of people with disabilities in all phases of the employment life cycle --- from recruitment and hiring, to retention and advancement.

In Executive Order (EO) 14035 *Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce*, President Biden highlighted accessibility as one of the great equalizers which, among other things, leads to a stronger and more effective workforce and affords individuals with disabilities an equitable and inclusive work environment.  The Access Board's work squarely supports this philosophy.

### Summary of Key Accomplishments in FY 2023

#### ABA Enforcement

To achieve Objective 3.1 during FY 2022, the Access Board received 201 new ABA complaints and closed 167 complaints.  Presented below in Table 1 are ABA caseload statistics for FY 2023, as well as comparative data for FYs 2021 and 2022.  (***Note:*** All tabular data provided in this section about ABA cases were compiled from the Access Board's cloud-based Complaint Tracking System \[CTS], which is the official repository of all ABA complaint files.)

##### Table 1: ABA Caseload Statistics (FYs 2021-2023)

‡ Due to a typographical error, in Table 1 of last year’s report the agency incorrectly noted the numbers of complaints closed during FYs 2021 and 2022; the correct numbers are reflected here.

Of the 167 ABA cases closed in FY 2023, about 32% (54 cases) were closed after the federal agency (or other facility owner/leaseholder) took corrective action to remedy building elements or features determined by the Access Board’s investigative findings to be ABA violations under the applicable accessibility standard.

In brief, the 54 ABA complaints closed in FY 2023 on the basis of completed corrective action can be segmented into four broad categories by facility type:

- **Defense-related and Veterans Facilities**:  The Access Board successfully resolved eight ABA complaints against the DoD and VA, including cases relating to: Fleet Readiness Center Southeast, a Navy facility aboard Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, FL (a multi-year project to install two new platform lifts in one building); The Dalles Lock and Dam, an Army Corps of Engineers facility on the Columbia River in The Dalles, OR (installation of four new accessible employee parking spaces); Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base in Montgomery, AL (installation of two new curb ramps); the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth in Fort Leavenworth, KS (repair of a lift at the visitor entrance); and the Nashville VA Medical Center in Nashville, TN (repair of a parking garage elevator).
- **Post Offices**:  The Access Board successfully resolved 34 ABA complaints relating to USPS facilities, with major remedial work completed at post offices in: Clearwater, FL (installation of a new sidewalk connecting the on-site public bus stop to the shopping center where the leased post office is located); Newport, ME (installation of a new van accessible parking space and entrance ramp); New Concord, OH (installation of a new entrance ramp); Tallahassee, FL (renovation of employee restrooms to install new accessible stalls); and New York City’s Lenox Hill neighborhood (repair of automatic door at the accessible entrance).
- **General Services Administration Facilities**:  The Access Board also successfully resolved seven ABA complaints relating to facilities owned or leased by GSA, including: the Robert Jackson United States Courthouse in Buffalo, NY (installation of passenger loading zone); the Joe Evins Federal Building in Oak Ridge, TN (remediation of violations related to accessible parking spaces); a Drug Enforcement Agency building in Detroit, MI (reconfiguration of security barriers to create exterior accessible routes).
- **Other ABA-Covered Facilities:**  In addition, significant corrective action projects were completed at five other ABA-covered facilities, including: Hawaii Volcanoes National Park (a multi-year effort to install compliant accessible parking spaces at the more than 20 parking lots throughout the Park); the research campus of the Environmental Protection Agency in Research Triangle Park, NC (adjustment of manual opening forces of 30 interior doors to bring them into compliance); and the Bay Area Discovery Museum in Sausalito, CA, a private museum operated on NPS land via a concession agreement (remediation of violations at several buildings and elements throughout the campus, including multiple issues related to accessible routes, doors, entrances, exhibits, and play areas).

The balance of ABA cases closed in FY 2023 --- 113 out of 167, or 68% --- were concluded for a range of technical or legal reasons:  22 because investigations revealed that the Access Board lacked jurisdiction (because, for example, the building was built prior to 1968 and not altered since, and so not covered by the ABA); 17 because investigations revealed that the complaint allegations did not constitute an ABA violation (because, for example, a building inspection revealed that the element at issue did in fact meet the minimum scoping requirements or technical specifications in the ABA standards); 1 where the standard-setting agency (USPS) issued a waiver; and 73 where the Access Board referred the matter directly to another entity (usually a federal enforcement agency) since it determined, without an investigation, that the ABA did not apply to the facts complained of but that another disability civil rights law, such as the ADA or the Fair Housing Act, did.

For many years, the Access Board’s practice for referrals was to simply provide complainants with information on how to file their non-ABA complaints with the appropriate agency.  But, in an effort to lessen the burden on these individuals, in FY 2022 the Access Board slowly began implementing a process to forward the complaint directly to the correct agency, after obtaining complainants’ permission to disclose their identities.  The Access Board expanded this implementation during FY 2023 so that now direct referral is a standard operating procedure.

Table 2 below provides data for ABA cases closed in FY 2023 by reason for case closure.

† In contrast to FY 2022 and years prior, beginning with FY 2023, the Access Board is no longer including in its counts of received and closed complaints those matters which it closed for administrative reasons, ranging from unintelligibility or “spam” filings to complaints that provided insufficient detail to discern the nature of the allegations or to allow enforcement staff to contact the complainant to gather additional/clarifying information.

Table 3 below provides similar case closure data about the bases for ABA cases closures, but from a longitudinal perspective for FYs 2020 -- 2022.

† The note concerning administrative closures on the preceding page largely explains the decrease from FY 2022 to FY 2023 in the numbers of received ABA complaints (242 down to 201) and closed ABA complaints (197 down to 167).

#### Raising Awareness of ABA Compliance and Enforcement

Aside from ABA enforcement, Objective 3.1 also addresses enhancing awareness of the ABA and the Access Board’s enforcement role.  EO 14035 *Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce*, among other things, requires the Access Board to work with agencies to ensure that their facilities not only comply with the ABA and related standards, but also go beyond those legal requirements to maximize the accessibility of agency workplaces.  As a follow-up to its resource, “[Recommendations and Resources to Assist Agencies in Identifying and Advancing Priorities for Facility Accessibility]({{ site.baseurl }}/deia-recommendations/),” which was developed and disseminated to agencies government-wide by OPM in FY 2022, during FY 2023 the Access Board began development of a checklist federal agencies can use to assess the accessibility of their facilities --- with a focus on the scoping provisions and technical specifications in the ABA standards related to those elements that give rise to most of the ABA complaints received, i.e., those related to parking, accessible routes, doors, entrances, toilet rooms, and ramps and curb ramps.  In FY 2024, the Access Board plans to finalize the checklist and disseminate it.

The Access Board also continues to conduct webinars and trainings and provide technical assistance on the accessibility of the federal workspace, with specific webinars on the topic being presented in November 2022 (“DEIA: What Does It Mean to Have Accessibility in the Federal Workplace?”) and May 2023 (“Accessibility and Accommodations in the Federal Workplace: Driving Success in Employment and Performance”).

Additionally, for the benefit of other agencies and the public at-large, the Access Board continues to publicize results from its ABA enforcement program, specifically on completed corrective actions, on its website and social media accounts, and, in FY 2024, it will disseminate a video on the ABA, the Access Board’s enforcement role, and the process for complaint filing.

In its Equity Action Plan, published in January 2022, as required by EO 13985 *Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government*, the Access Board set forth aims for ensuring that its ABA compliance and enforcement program considers the needs and rights of historically underserved communities with high incidences of disability, with a focus on working “with federal agencies to establish formal ABA compliance strategies aimed at proactively ensuring the accessibility of buildings and facilities in underserved communities through accessibility assessments and the remediation of architectural barriers.”  The Access Board’s Equity Action Plan and subsequent outreach activities contribute to achieving not only Objective 3.1, but also Objective 4.1 in the next section.

During FY 2023, the Access Board developed its internal three-part strategy for this effort: identifying underserved communities; identifying federal buildings and facilities in those communities, particularly those where in-person government services are provided to the public; and conducting outreach to the federal agencies that own or lease such facilities, both urging them to conduct accessibility assessments of those facilities and providing them with tools, resources, and technical assistance necessary to carry out those assessments.

In the final quarter of FY 2023, the Access Board completed the first prong of its strategy --- identifying underserved communities --- by developing a list of the 104 counties nationwide where: (a) a majority of the population is non-white (as presented in statistical data from the 2020 Decennial Census), and (b) 10% or more of the population reported (in 2021 5-year American Community Survey data) having an ambulatory disability. At the beginning of FY 2024, the Access Board began work on the second prong of its strategy --- identifying all federal facilities in each of the 104 counties.  The Access Board anticipates completing this part of the effort --- and the project as a whole --- by the end of FY 2024.

In another example of outreach to agencies who have a presence in underserved communities, during FY 2023 the Access Board held meetings with leadership and staff of the Indian Health Service (IHS) --- a component of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and which provides health care in a variety of settings in hundreds of American Indian and Alaska Native communities—with a focus on learning about accessibility barriers encountered at those health care facilities and understanding how the Access Board’s resources can best be leveraged to support IHS in remediating those barriers.  The Access Board plans to continue these efforts in FY 2024 and, in addition, will continue to further develop its existing relationship with the office of the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs at DOI, who has responsibility for the approximately 5,000 facilities of the Bureaus of Indian Affairs, Indian Education, and Trust Fund Administration.

During FY 2023, the Access Board completed the transition to a new cloud-based complaint tracking system that is more efficient and cost-effective than the version the agency had been using for the past decade.

Of the four ABA standard-setting agencies, only HUD has not yet adopted the Access Board’s ABA Accessibility Standards, which were promulgated in 2004.  HUD still uses an older accessibility standard from 1984 --- the UFAS --- as the basis for evaluating housing accessibility under the ABA and Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  According to its Spring 2023 Semiannual Regulatory Agenda, HUD planned to issue a proposed rule to update and improve its ABA standards applicable to residential structures subject to the ABA by December 2023.

#### Accessible ICT and Federal Collaboration

Board ICT staff continued leading federal efforts to advance digital accessibility.  Congressional activities increased focus on federal agency web accessibility and added a new annual federal agency Section 508 reporting requirement.  The Access Board partnered, almost daily, with the GSA Government-wide IT Accessibility Program team, and from January 2023 to September 2023, Board staff met at least weekly with OMB, GSA, and the White House Office of Science Technology Policy to develop in-depth Section 508 agency self-assessment criteria that were issued to federal agencies for a new annual report to Congress.
Board staff also provided technical assistance to agencies in completing the self-assessment through office hours, reoccurring meetings, and fielding questions via listservs, emails, and phone calls. Finally, Board staff provided subject matter expertise in reviewing and analyzing agency responses and assisted GSA in interpreting the data for the report.

Under EO 14035 *Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce*, the Access Board partnered with a variety of agencies to promote accessibility and inclusion of individuals with disabilities in federal service throughout the year.  In November 2022, Board staff conducted a webinar that reviewed physical and digital accessibility requirements in the federal workspace that implement DEIA.  In January 2023, the Access Board hosted a webinar with the FCC about developing and strengthening accessibility training and testing programs within the federal government to improve access for federal employees.  In May 2023, the Access Board presented a webinar featuring staff from the Departments of State and Education, showcasing how accessibility and accommodations in the federal workplace drive career success in federal employment for employees with disabilities.

In April, Board staff briefed an audience of key federal disability employment program leaders on Section 508 requirements to improve workforce access to ensure inclusion of employees with disabilities.  In June 2023, Access Board staff presented two sessions at the national Deaf and Hard of Hearing in Government conference.  The first session addressed accessibility in the federal workplace to support implementation of EO 14035 with a panel of experts from U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Department of Labor’s Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP).  The second session was co-presented with staff from Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) staff on the technical provisions of Section 508.

In August, staff presented to a national audience of state vocational rehabilitation leaders to strengthen accessibility in the workplace. Staff also presented at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s (EEOC) annual Excel conference and trained federal EEO staff on strategies for incorporating building and digital access for the workforce.

#### Model Employer of People with Disabilities

As underscored by EO 14035 *Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce*, the federal government, as the Nation's largest employer, has a special responsibility to lead by example in including people with disabilities in the workforce.  The Access Board prides itself on its history of inclusiveness in employment.  It is part of who the Access Board is as an agency, and the Access Board will continue this effort as it moves forward to be a model employer of people with disabilities (Objective 3.3).

In FY 2023, the Access Board took steps to ensure that leaders at all levels promote the vision for DEIA.  The agency maintained a new performance standard for supervisors and managers that focuses on employee career development and the cultivation of an inclusive, constructive work environment that is committed to EEO policies and principles and is based on transparent communication, mutual trust, and respect. 

During early FY 2023, the Access Board contracted with a leading diversity and inclusion consulting business to assist in its internal implementation of EO 14035 for its workforce.  Staff participated in a series of four internal trainings that expanded understanding and empathy of Indigenous people, facilitated interactive conversations on the benefits of diversity, an update of appropriate disability terminology, and discussions that included personal experiences with micro aggressions.  These efforts stimulated additional conversations in small groups amongst staff and supervisors and established a foundation to encourage more dialogue and appreciation of diversity in our workforce and in serving the American public.

The Access Board maintains a file of "Schedule A" applicants that is reviewed prior to the posting of agency vacancies.  Schedule A provides a means for agencies to hire qualified people with disabilities outside of the usual process for hiring into the competitive service.  Individuals with disabilities may be hired into "excepted service" positions and then converted to the competitive service after having demonstrated successful job performance over a period of time.
