## Goal #3: Improve the Accessibility of the Federal Government

The Access Board's third strategic goal is supported by three objectives, which are:

- Objective 3.1: Improve the accessibility of federal buildings and facilities through enhanced awareness and robust enforcement of the ABA.
- Objective 3.2: Improve accessibility of federal information and communication technology through collaboration with other federal agencies.
- Objective 3.3: Be a model employer of persons with disabilities.

### Background

Improving the accessibility of the federal government is a foundational pillar of the Access Board's mission.  The agency was established by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to be the sole agency responsible for the enforcement of the ABA.  he ABA requires most buildings designed, constructed, altered, or leased by the federal government --- along with certain other federally-financed facilities --- to be accessible to, and usable by, people with disabilities.  The agency's ABA compliance and enforcement program processes and investigates complaints and, when violations are found, works with the appropriate federal agency or facility owner/leaseholder to remedy these barriers.

In any given year, the Access Board receives ABA complaints concerning a wide range of federal buildings and facilities, such as: federal office buildings and United States Courthouses; Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers and Community-Based Outpatient Clinics; SSA offices; post offices; National Parks; and Department of Defense (DoD) facilities, including buildings where civilians are employed, base exchanges, military family housing, and Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) facilities.

Enforcement program staff also work proactively with federal agencies and others to ensure that relevant officials at headquarters, regional and field offices, and local sites have a working knowledge of their accessibility obligations.  The Access Board has cultivated productive working relationships with senior leaders at its sister federal agencies, particularly those that own, manage, or lease federal properties or see frequent ABA complaints.

While the Access Board continues to successfully execute its ABA-related mandates, its responsibilities have expanded significantly during its nearly 50-year history.  One such duty includes ensuring that ICT is accessible to and usable by peole with disabilities, as required under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Federal agencies must develop, procure, maintain, and use ICT that is accessible. This ensures equal access to federal employment for people with disabilities and reduces the need for agencies to undertake individual accommodations. In addition, this ensures that members of the public who are individuals with disabilities will have access to government information and services. The Access Board is undertaking initiatives in partnership with other federal agencies to promote and advance ICT accessibility throughout the federal sector.

In all of its work, the Access Board seeks to remove barriers to equity and inclusion for, and increase the dignity and respect of, individuals with disabilities.  But the Access Board acknowledges that these outward, public-facing endeavors cannot succeed if it does not also focus its efforts on its own employees.  As such, the Access Board continuously strives to be a model employer of people with disabilities in all phases of the employment life cycle --- from recruitment and hiring, to retention and advancement.

In Executive Order (EO) 14035 *Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce*, President Biden highlighted accessibility as one of the great equalizers which, among other things, leads to a stronger and more effective workforce and affords individuals with disabilities an equitable and inclusive work environment.  The Access Board's work squarely supports this philosophy.

### Summary of Key Accomplishments in FY 2024

#### ABA Enforcement

With respect to Objective 3.1, during FY 2024 the Access Board received 341 new ABA complaints (69.7% increase in filings from FY 2023) and closed 265 complaints (58.7% increase from FY 2023), which includes 85 complaints where federal agencies (or other facility owner/leaseholder) took corrective action to remediate violations of the applicable accessibility standard—representing a 57.4% increase over the previous year and approximately one-third (32.1%) of all closures.

Presented in Table 1 are ABA caseload statistics for FY 2024, as well as comparative data for FYs 2022 and 2023.   (***Note:*** All tabular data provided in this section about ABA cases were compiled from the Access Board's cloud-based Complaint Tracking System \[CTS], which is the official repository of all ABA complaint files.)

##### Table 1: ABA Caseload Statistics (FYs 2022-2024)

| ABA Cases                        | FY 2022 | FY 2023 | FY 2024 |

| Complaints Closed (end of FY)    |   127   |   161   |   237   |
{: .par-prose }

In summary, the 85 ABA complaints closed in FY 2024 on the basis of completed corrective action can be broken down into four broad categories by facility type:

##### Defense-related and Veterans Facilities

The Access Board successfully resolved 17 ABA complaints against the Departement of Defense and Veterans Affairs, including cases relating to:

- VA Community Based Outpatient Clinics in Sarasota, Florida, and Franklin, North Carolina -- a variety of mandatory corrective actions to enhance or install accessible parking spaces and improve exterior accessible routes; 
- Biloxi VA Medical Center (Mississippi) -- installation of a van accessible parking space in the lot serving the Emergency Department;
- Hill Air Force Base (Utah) -- installation of two entrance ramps, four power-assisted door openers, and a van accessible parking space at Building 590; 
- Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (Washington) -- voluntary corrective action to install a power-assisted interior door in Building 435;
- Schriever Space Force Base (Colorado) -- repairing elevators in Building 300, 301, and 400;
- the Department of Defense Educational Activity’s Fort Knox Middle High School (Kentucky) -- elevator repair; and
- the installation of required accessible parking spaces in certain lots at: Hill Air Force Base (Utah); Naval Air Station Fallon (Nevada); Tinker Air Force Base (Oklahoma); the Ohio Army National Guard facility in North Canton, Ohio; and a building aboard Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam (Hawaii) housing Naval Surface Group Middle Pacific (COMNAVSURFGRU MIDPAC). 

###### Post Offices and other USPS facilities

The Access Board successfully resolved 59 ABA complaints relating to U.S. Postal Service facilities, with remedial work completed at Processing and Distribution Centers in Indianapolis, Los Angeles, and Dulles, Virginia—involving the installation of compliant accessible parking spaces in the employee parking lots, often exceeding the minimum requirements in the standards—and at several post offices, including those in:

- Waltham, Massachusetts -- installation of a new entrance ramp to replace the existing non-compliant ramp, and a new, compliant van accessible parking space; 
- Iowa City, Iowa -- major improvements to accessible parking and accessible route to the entrance; 
- Woodstown, New Jersey -- replacement of the exterior platform lift; and
- Hampton, Virginia -- replacement of the exterior platform lift.

###### GSA Facilities

The Access Board also successfully resolved 7 ABA complaints relating to the following facilities owned or leased by GSA:

- Thomas P. O’Neill Federal Building (Boston, Massachusetts) -- repair of power-assisted entrance doors; 
-	Raul Castro Land Port of Entry (Douglas, Arizona) -- installation of required accessible parking spaces in the employee parking lot; 
-	Leased space in commercial office buildings in Houston, Texas (the Houston Regional Office of the State Department’s Office of Foreign Missions) and Alexandria, Louisiana (various agencies) –- elevator repairs; and 
-	Sioux City Federal Building and United States Courthouse (Sioux City, Iowa) –- GSA completed a major corrective action project by: creating an accessible single-user toilet room on the third floor of the building; constructing a compliant pedestrian ramp at the rear entrance; adding a compliant employee entrance with automatic door opener at the rear of the building; and installing a compliant van accessible parking space and access aisle in the rear parking lot. 

###### Other ABA-Covered Facilities

In addition, significant corrective action projects were completed at two other ABA-covered facilities:

- United States Penitentiary Leavenworth (Kansas) -- the Bureau of Prisons installed a new inclined, exterior platform lift to afford wheelchair/scooter access to visitors at the main entrance; and
- The DOE’s Oak Ridge Site (Tennessee) -- the Department made a variety of improvements to exterior accessible routes and ramps serving the various wings of Building 2714.

The balance of ABA cases closed at the end of FY 2024—180 out of 265, or 67.92% --- were concluded for a range of technical or legal reasons: 27 because investigations revealed that the Access Board lacked jurisdiction (for example, the building was built prior to 1968 and not altered since, and so not covered by the ABA); 29 because investigations revealed that the complaint allegations did not constitute an ABA violation (for example, a building inspection revealed that the element at issue did in fact meet the minimum scoping requirements or technical specifications in the ABA standards); 1 where the standard-setting agency (USPS) issued a waiver; and 123 where the Board made a referral since it determined, without an investigation, that the ABA did not apply to the complainant’s concerns but that another disability civil rights law, such as the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, or the Fair Housing Act, did.

With respect to referrals, for many years the Access Board’s practice was to simply provide complainants with information on how to file their non-ABA complaints with the appropriate agency.  In an effort to lessen the burden on these individuals, in FY 2022 the Access Board began implementing a process to forward the complaint directly to the correct agency, after obtaining complainants’ permission to disclose their identities.  While the Access Board expanded this implementation during FY 2023, the nearly 70% increase in new complaint filings from FY 2023 (201) to FY 2024 (341) led the Board to revert in FY 2024 to its original longstanding practice in order to devote more of the already-limited staff resources to investigating substantive complaints

‡ Note: In contrast to FY 2022 and prior, beginning in FY 2023 we no longer included complaints closed for administrative reasons in our counts of received and closed complaints.  This includes unintelligible or "spam" filings and complaints that lacked sufficient details to discern the nature of the allegations.  This explains the decrease from FY 2022 to FY 2023 in the numbers of: received ABA complaints (241 down to 201); closed ABA complaints (197 down to 167); and administrative closures (58 down to 0).

During FY 2024, a new, enforceable ABA standard went into effect with GSA’s July adoption of PROWAG as part of its ABA accessibility standards.  The Access Board provided extensive feedback to GSA during the interagency review process for the rulemaking, including a clarification of the scope and economic impact of the rule which was broader and more significant than that originally anticipated by GSA.  The Access Board expects to begin receiving relevant complaints in FY 2025, with increasing complaint filings in subsequent years as the public gains a greater familiarity with the requirements and as more ABA-covered construction and alteration projects related to pedestrian facilities in the public right-of-way are carried out.

#### Raising Awareness of ABA Compliance and Enforcement

Aside from ABA enforcement, Objective 3.1 also addresses enhancing awareness of the ABA and the Access Board’s enforcement role. For the benefit of other agencies and the public at-large, the Access Board continues to publicize results from its ABA enforcement program on its website and social media accounts.  In FY 2024, the Access Board disseminated a YouTube video on the ABA, the Board’s enforcement role, and the process for complaint filing.

As a follow-up to its resource, "Recommendations and Resources to Assist Agencies in Identifying and Advancing Priorities for Facility Accessibility" (developed and disseminated to agencies government-wide by OPM in FY 2022), the Access Board planned to develop and disseminate a checklist federal agencies could use to assess the accessibility of their facilities, in FY 2024.  However, due to the exigencies of the ABA enforcement program (and the nearly 70% increase in complaint filings from the year prior), the Access Board was forced to delay the checklist project to focus on handling substantive ABA complaints. 

In recent years, the Access Board has sought to ensure that its ABA enforcement program considers the needs and rights of historically underserved communities with high incidences of disability, with a focus on working with federal agencies to ascertain the state of accessibility of their facilities in those communities.  For example, as part of the Access Board’s work on the Equity Action Plan required by EO 13985 _Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government_, the Board identified the 104 majority-minority counties nationwide where 10% or more of the population reported (in 2021 5-year American Community Survey data) having an ambulatory disability.  During FY 2024, the Access Board identified the post offices in those communities and formally asked USPS to conduct accessibility compliance reviews of those facilities.

In another example of outreach to agencies who have a presence in underserved communities, in recent years the Access Board has sought to initiate and develop relationships with agencies that provide in-person services to American Indians and Alaska Natives at ABA-covered facilities.  The Board held meetings with leadership and staff of the Indian Health Service (IHS) --- a component of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which provides health care in a variety of settings in hundreds of American Indian and Alaska Native communities—and obtained data on accessibility barriers that the agency has identified at its facilities.  The Access Board continued its review of that data in FY 2024, and in FY 2025 plans to identify the Access Board resources that can best be leveraged to support the IHS in remediating those barriers.  In FY 2025, the Access Board also plans to further develop its existing relationship with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs at DOI, which has responsibility for approximately 5,000 facilities of the Bureaus of Indian Affairs, Indian Education, and Trust Fund Administration.

The Access Board’s Equity Action Plan and subsequent outreach activities contribute to achieving not only Objective 3.1 but also Objective 4.1, which is outlined in the next section and involves identifying and addressing inequities in accessibility faced by underserved communities.

#### Complaint Tracking System (CTS) ####

During FY 2023, the Access Board completed the transition to the cloud-based CTS that is more efficient and cost-effective than the previous complaint tracking system that the agency was using.  During FY 2024, the Access Board worked with the CTS contractor to further refine the system to maximize efficiency and productivity -- a process which continues into FY 2025.

Of the four ABA standard-setting agencies, only the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has not yet adopted the Access Board’s ABA Accessibility Standards (ABAAS), which were promulgated in 2004.  HUD still uses an older accessibility standard from 1984—the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) --- as the basis for evaluating housing accessibility under the ABA and Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  In its recent regulatory agendas, HUD has stated its intention to issue a proposed rule to update and improve its standards applicable to residential structures subject to the ABA.

#### Accessible Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Federal Agency Collaboration

Board ICT staff continued leading federal efforts to advance digital accessibility.  Congressional activities increased focus on federal agency ICT accessibility and mandated an annual federal agency Section 508 reporting requirement in FY 2023.  During the first quarter of FY 2024, Board ICT staff partnered with GSA’s Government-wide IT Accessibility Program team, OMB, and the White House Office of Science Technology Policy (OSTP) to analyze agency responses to the FY 2023 self-assessment and provided input for the FY 2023 GSA report to Congress. 

During the second and third quarters of FY 2024, the Access Board, GSA, OMB, and OSTP updated and improved the Section 508 agency assessment criteria based on feedback from agencies and issued the FY 2024 assessment. Board staff provided technical assistance to agencies completing the self-assessment via open-office hours, recurring meetings, and answered questions via Section 508 listservs, emails, and phone calls. Board staff also provided subject matter expertise in reviewing and analyzing FY 2024 agency responses to assist the GSA in interpreting the data for the report, which will be issued in FY 2025.

OMB Memo [M-24-08 Strengthening Digital Accessibility and the Management of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/ofcio/m-24-08-strengthening-digital-accessibility-and-the-management-of-section-508-of-the-rehabilitation-act/) identified several tasks for the Access Board:

- In collaboration with GSA and OMB, review and update government-wide resources related to the accessibility of websites and digital services; several related tasks have been completed including development of best practices for establishing and maintaining a public feedback mechanism, and best practices for establishing and maintaining a formal Section 508 complaint process.  Additional contributions to Section508.gov included social media accessibility, reviewing and updating existing guidance, and improving the accuracy and usability of the Accessibility Requirements Tool, which identifies applicable Section 508 requirements for ICT contracts.
- In collaboration with GSA and OPM, identify opportunities to establish a professional certification program and create and publish guidelines for acceptable commercial certifications for Section 508 program managers.  This entailed reviewing existing certification programs in federal government and interviews with EEOC, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), USDA, and DOD, who manage learning management systems, programs, trainings, and certifications, to explore the feasibility of establishing a certification for Section 508 program managers that could elevate the skills and capabilities in ICT accessibility.  The agency partners drafted the report and briefed OMB. At the end of FY 2024, it was in final review with upper management at our partner agencies.

The Access Board continued development on the ICT Testing Baseline Portfolio subdomain, a notable expansion of guidance materials available for Section 508 and ICT accessibility. To improve the evaluation of ICT for Section 508 conformance across federal agencies, the Access Board develops and maintains ICT Testing Baselines for various types of ICT in partnership with GSA. Each Baseline identifies accessibility properties and provides comprehensive evaluation instructions to ensure accurate test results for each accessibility requirement. The Access Board test processes that incorporate the ICT Testing Baselines produce consistent test results and improve trust in their test reports. Many federal agencies participate and contribute to the Baseline Portfolio, including DHS, OPM, SSA, and HHS. 
In FY 2024, the Access Board released a new Baseline for Electronic Documents and an update to the Baseline for Web. The Baselines are available to federal agencies and industry to improve accessibility testing. The Access Board assisted GSA with managing the Federal CIO Council funds and contractor oversight that aid in the release of the Baseline for Documents and updates to the Baseline Portfolio site. 
Related to the Baseline Portfolio, the Access Board assisted DHS with updates to the Trusted Tester methodology for web content to ensure alignment to the Baseline for Web. Contributions included review of updated test instructions, testing tool updates, training content, and resolution of issues submitted by testers.

 
In FY 2023 and FY 2024, the Access Board led an interagency working group comprised of members and leaders of the Accessibility Community of Practice (ACOP) to develop guidance for procurement of ICT and the use of Accessibility Conformance Reports. The guidance provides instructions and standard procedures for obtaining and comparing Accessibility Conformance Reports (ACR) for ICT products to aid in identifying the product that best meets Section 508 requirements. The Access Board assisted GSA with managing the Federal CIO Council funding received for this project, led working group meetings and content reviews, and finalized the report. The Access Board presented the guidance with the co-chair of the ACOP to the Federal CIO Council.

#### Model Employer of People with Disabilities

As underscored by EO 14035 *Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce*, the federal government, as the Nation's largest employer, has a special responsibility to lead by example in including people with disabilities in the workforce.  The Access Board prides itself on its history of inclusiveness in employment.  It is part of who the Access Board is as an agency, and the Access Board will continue this effort as it moves forward to be a model employer of people with disabilities (Objective 3.3).

In FY 2024, the Access Board updated performance standards for supervisors that fosters an inclusive work environment where diversity and individual differences are valued and leveraged.  Supervisors are highly encouraged to consistently make decisions and interact with subordinate staff in ways designed to create and maintain a workplace free from discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, while demonstrating integrity, sound judgment, and high ethical standards.

The Access Board has conducted the annual self-assessment of Section 717 and Section 501 programs against the essential elements as prescribed by Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive 715.  The agency has analyzed its workforce profiles and conducted barrier analyses aimed at detecting whether any management or personnel policy, procedure, or practice is operating to disadvantage any group based on race, national origin, gender, or disability.

The Access Board also created an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Awards Program that will recognize Access Board employees and senior leaders for their achievements, contributions, and efforts in supporting equal employment opportunity in the Access Board workplace.  The EEO Awards Program is intended to acknowledge and encourage significant and continued efforts in promoting equal employment opportunity into everyday practice to make EEO a fundamental part of the Access Board workplace culture. EEO in the workplace helps to ensure that all employees feel valued for the work they do in a fair, diverse, and inclusive environment.

To facilitate the hiring, placement, and advancement of individuals with disabilities, the Access Board participated in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Disability Self-Identification Project, which encourages all employees to self-identify their disability status. Self-identification of disability status is essential for effective data collection and analysis of the Access Board’s hiring efforts.

The Access Board continues to maintain a file of “Schedule A” applicants that is reviewed prior to the posting of agency vacancies. Schedule A provides a means for agencies to hire qualified people with disabilities outside of the usual process for hiring into the competitive service.  Individuals with disabilities may be hired into “excepted service” positions and then converted to the competitive service after having demonstrated successful job performance over a period of time.
