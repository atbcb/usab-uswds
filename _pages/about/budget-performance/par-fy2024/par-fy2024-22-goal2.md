## Goal #2: Provide Education and Information on the Importance and Implementation of Accessible Design

The Access Board's second strategic goal is supported by four objectives, which are:

- Objective 2.1: Provide training on accessible design.
- Objective 2.2: Provide technical assistance on implementation of accessibility guidelines and standards.
- Objective 2.3: Create educational materials to promote understanding of accessible design.
- Objective 2.4: Use stakeholders' feedback to improve our information services.

### Background

The Access Board provides technical assistance (TA) to the public on its guidelines and standards and on other aspects of accessible design through a TA hotline, published guidance, and webinars and training. The agency responds to thousands of TA inquiries each year via phone and e-mail.  In recent years, the Access Board's website has also become a go-to resource on accessible design.  Users of the website can, among other things, view the Access Board's accessibility guidelines and standards, as well as animations illustrating the rationale behind the guidelines and standards and showing how accessible features are used by individuals with disabilities.  All published materials are downloadable in accessible formats.  Collectively, the Access Board's TA services play a critical role in assisting design professionals, governmental jurisdictions, people with disabilities, and other stakeholders understand and apply accessible design requirements.

### Summary of FY 2024 Key Accomplishments

#### Technical Assistance

The Access Board’s TA program is a signature service to the public, enabling the agency to achieve Objectives 2.1 and 2.2. Inquiries are fielded through the Access Board’s TA phone line and via e-mail. TA helps improve understanding of accessibility requirements and their application to specific, real challenges posed by members of the public. In FY 2024, Board staff managed over 5,700 TA inquiries, representing an 8% increase from FY 2023.

Central to the agency’s signature technical assistance services, Board staff use an internal Knowledge Management System (KMS) to efficiently track and manage inquiries.  Inquiries and staff answers are categorized and documented in the KMS.  Unique and challenging questions requiring additional consideration and research are marked for review and discussed during weekly staff meetings.  This information serves as a learning opportunity for technical staff and to gain consensus.  Final answers are then documented in the KMS, with hyper-linked references to relevant agency guidance, citations, responses to past TA inquiries, and notations about accessibility or design issues.  KMS data is also regularly analyzed to help reveal important technical assistance trends, hot topics, and incorporated into training, educational materials, and in some cases, rulemaking.

To ensure consistent and accurate staff responses to accessibility questions, the Access Board developed a knowledge management system (KMS) to collect and store information and guidance generated in its provision of TA. This internal, centralized repository enables staff to document and categorize questions received and the specific answers provided by staff. The KMS supports Access Board staff in easily retrieving and providing consistent assistance to members of the public. Information housed in the KMS includes hyper-linked cross-references to agency guidance relevant to a given provision or topic, responses to past TA inquiries, and notations about accessibility or design issues that may warrant future attention by the agency (e.g., the development of educational and training materials). The Access Board expects this critical tool to pay great dividends by enhancing the clarity and consistency of the technical assistance it provides to the public daily

#### TA Guidance

As part of its TA program, the agency develops various educational materials (Objective 2.3) to help explain different aspects of its guidelines under the ADA, ABA, and other laws.  The agency’s issuance of guidance documents and other TA documents further illustrate the practical application of relevant existing ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines.  Additional documents include recommendations and best practices to improve access to a site, building, facility, space, element, or service.  Board staff produce informative animations that help design professionals understand the reason and method for applying the ADA and ABA Accessibility Standards.  The agency’s website provides a complete list of its [Guidance Documents]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidance.html) (including animations and videos) and its [TA documents]({{ site.baseurl }}/tad).

The Access Board provides publicly available guides/technical bulletins that cover Chapters 1-6 and signage in Chapter 7 of the ADA and ABA.  During FY 2024, Board staff worked diligently on rulemaking efforts.  Additional work on guides and technical bulletins will continue during FY 2025.

#### Other Technical Assistance and Resources

The Access Board achieves Objective 2.3 through other efforts, such as collaborations, resources, and public communication. In FY 2024, Board staff accomplished several interagency collaborations, including in-depth technical assistance to the National Institute of Health (NIH), GSA, Social Security Administration (SSA), and a partnership with Amtrak to continuously facilitate accessibility improvements as rail cars are updated. 

Board staff provided accessibility guidance for the development of a new Griffin Museum of Science and Industry facility and improving accessibility for the Lincoln Home National Historic Site (National Park Service). In addition to site specific guidance, Board staff met with a delegation from the Republic of Indonesia to discuss implementing accessibility standards in their country. In an ongoing collaboration with HUD accessibility staff, Board staff sought to unify responses for residential requirements, including Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) and Fair Housing.

#### Access Board Website

In FY 2024, the Access Board continued refining and updating the agency website as the national resource on ADA and ABA accessible design, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, and other accessibility provisions. Through this site, the Access Board provides updates to federal agencies and members of the public on rulemaking, research, ABA enforcement, training, technical assistance, and other programs. 

The Access Board routinely contributes to technical assistance and guidance materials posted to [Section508.gov](https://www.section508.gov/).  Board staff contributed to the agency instructions for the government-wide Section 508 assessment, accessible social media guidance, best practices for Section 508 complaints, and articles on typography and equations.

#### Agency-Sponsored Trainings and Webinars

The Access Board hosts monthly accessibility webinars and provides a wide range of training at national conferences to specific audiences throughout the year.  In FY 2024, Board staff increased the number of training participants by 18% over FY 2023 through the presentation of 117 webinars and trainings, reaching approximately 25,000 participants.

As each rule becomes final, the Access Board experiences a spike in training requests.  Following issuance of the final rule for Public Right-of-Way Accessibility Guidelines (PROWAG) in August 2023, the Access Board provided numerous trainings (both in-person and virtually) to state and local departments of transportation, as well as professional organizations for transportation planners, engineers, and landscape designers.

Access Board staff strive to improve cost efficiencies across the federal government.  Previously, Board staff responded to numerous individual training requests from multiple contacts within one federal agency.  During FY 2024, Board staff collaborated with the lead staff at federal agency headquarters to coordinate and consolidate training at the national level, and to establish reoccurring training annually.  This yielded greater consistent knowledge across federal agencies.

#### Facilitated Webinars

The Access Board's monthly webinars for the built and digital environments continue to be a valuable resource for disseminating technical information on accessibility guidelines and standards to a broad range of audiences.  Participants are provided the option to join live or to later view archived recordings posted on the website.  Currently, the Access Board hosts a catalog of 164 archived webinars. Additionally, there are 14 self-paced, archived webinars that offer continuing education credits (CEUs).

The built environment bi-monthly webinars ([AccessibilityOnline](https://www.accessibilityonline.org/)) focuses on the ADA and ABA Accessibility Standards and provides guidance on a range of facility types and covers common sources of confusion.  These monthly, 90-minute sessions are facilitated through a contractor.  All webinars include sign language interpreting and real-time captioning.  Continuing Education Units (CEU) are available to participants upon request.  Overall, the number of webinar participants (12,000) increased by 72% this year over FY 2023, which is attributed to the Board’s issuance of the final rule for PROWAG.

The Board's second bi-monthly series highlights [Section 508 Best Practices](https://www.accessibilityonline.org/cioc-508), in partnership with the Federal Chief Information Officer Council's Accessibility Community of Practice.  The Section 508 series provides a pipeline of information and best practices for federal agencies to emulate in meeting the accessible ICT requirements.  Recent topics include highlights from the government-wide Section 508 assessment, demystifying the procurement process, and enhancing accessibility through customer experience.
