## Goal #4: Promote Accessibility throughout Society

The Access Board's fourth strategic goal is supported by two objectives, which are:

- Objective 4.1: Identify and address inequities in accessibility faced by underserved communities.
- Objective 4.2: Identify and work to address barriers to accessibility beyond those covered by our guidelines and standards.

### Background

Under its statutory authority, the Access Board promotes accessibility throughout all segments of society.  This work includes various activities, including, but not limited to, interacting with members of the public; holding in-person and virtual public events, such as town hall meetings, listening sessions, among others; speaking at national and international conferences; meeting with national organizations and international delegates and officials; and delivering information via its public communication channels to a wide range of stakeholders and audiences.  In FY 2024, the agency continued applying various strategies and activities to ensure that greater awareness of accessibility permeates parts of society and to listen to and collect information and comments from people with disabilities, those who serve people with disabilities, and those whose work relates to implementing accessible design.

### Summary of Key Accomplishments in FY 2024

#### Public Events and Engagement

Under the agency’s bylaws, as revised in November 2022, the Access Board holds four Board Meetings per year, one of which is usually outside the Washington, D.C. area.  In general, two of the four meetings are in- person, and the other two are conducted remotely. Board Meetings are typically held over two or three days that include both informal (i.e., closed to the public) sessions and formal (i.e., open to the public) sessions.  Some of the sessions often serve as opportunities for Board Members and staff to strategize ways to accomplish Goal #4 and to hold in-person and virtual public events to gather information on accessible design and accessibility barriers and engage with members of the public and organizations.

During FY 2024, the Governing Board met in October 2023, and in January, April, and July 2024. In October and January, the formal sessions were open to the public through live web streams.  In April, the Access Board held a town hall meeting in Los Angeles, CA for members of the public to join in person and provide public comments on the state of accessibility in the local community.  At the July meeting, the formal session was hybrid for members of the public, with in-person attendance at the Access Board’s office building. Archival video recordings of formal sessions of Board Meetings are also posted on the Access Board’s [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5tRWTtV5eSw68N3tSpmyWw) and website.

During the April Board meeting in Los Angeles, a series of meetings were held to better understand the state of accessibility in the region and within the entertainment industry. The Board spent an entire day in meetings with representatives of the entertainment industry to understand the accessibility challenges faced by working professionals with disabilities in the industry, as well as the progress that is being made to make productions more accessible. The Board’s meetings were hosted at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which has been embarking on its own accessibility efforts. In roundtables, the Board learned from creatives (actors, writers, directors, and musicians) with disabilities.  The Access Board learned about authentic casting practices and writers with disabilities telling authentic stories, along with accessibility issues with trailers, sets and locations, wardrobe and make-up areas, and employment-related websites. The Access Board also learned from studio, network, and streamer representatives regarding efforts to improve the accessibility of productions and representation of individuals with disabilities, the building of strategic alliances with disability-led organizations, and the use of AI in audio descriptions.

Additionally, while in Los Angeles, the Access Board visited Nickelodeon and Netflix. At Nickelodeon, the Board learned about the studio’s disability inclusion efforts and work towards greater accessibility for their workforce and visitors. At Netflix, the Board viewed a demonstration of open audio description and captions and spoke with staff regarding the process of developing these accessibility features. Additionally, the Board met with Disability Rights California (DRC), an advocacy organization for Californians with disabilities. DRC representatives described myriad accessibility challenges currently being addressed in California, including housing accessibility, transportation issues, and accessible voting.

The Board also participated in a series of conversations with City of Los Angeles officials, organized in collaboration with the city’s [Department on Disability](https://disability.lacity.gov/) and hosted at the Loyola Law School’s Coelho Center for Disability Law, Policy and Innovation. Former United States Representative Tony Coelho, one of the primary sponsors of the ADA, began the day with comments highlighting the progress that has been made to advance accessibility and the opportunities for improvement that remain. Following the meeting, the Board participated in a site visit with city, LA Metro, and LA28 representatives at the Los Angeles Convention Center Olympic and Paralympic venue and the planned Pico Station transportation hub to better understand the accessibility issues that are to be addressed before the 2028 Summer Games.

The Board held its annual town hall meeting at The California Endowment, where it heard directly from Los Angeles residents regarding local accessibility concerns. Eight presidentially appointed Public Members represented the Board, as well as Federal Member and Board Vice-Chair Katy Kale, Deputy Administrator of GSA, and Federal Member Taryn Williams, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Disability Employment Policy at DOL. Representatives from the Departments of Commerce, Education, Housing and Urban Development, and Veterans Affairs were also present. Brenda Shockley, Deputy Mayor of Economic Opportunity for the City of Los Angeles, provided opening remarks.

150 individuals attended the in-person town hall meeting; over 30 community members testified during the public comment portion of the town hall. Participants shared a range of concerns including, among others, accessibility of pedestrian facilities in the public-right-of-way (sidewalks, curb ramps, railroad crossings, bike lanes); transportation challenges; accessibility of the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games; digital accessibility; accessibility of historic buildings; access for individuals who are hard of hearing; accessibility of casinos; and issues related to electromagnetic sensitivities. After the town hall meeting, the Access Board held a networking event to provide opportunities for members of the public to further interact and engage with Board Members and staff. This activity supported Objective 4.1, whereby Board Members and staff sought to better understand accessibility inequities, including those in underserved communities. The Access Board will consider this information as it strategizes on how its services and programs may serve the public beyond rulemaking, thus supporting Objective 4.2.

At the end of FY 2024, Board staff began preparation for the July 2025 Board Meeting in New Orleans. This Board Meeting will primarily focus on accessibility and discrimination in transportation, temporary event spaces, and the public-rights-of-way. In September 2024, some Board staff traveled to New Orleans to meet with a range of stakeholders: disability organizations; residents and tourism advocates; City of New Orleans government officials; multi-tourism planning organizations. These meetings provided opportunities for the Access Board to listen to stakeholders and learn more about accessibility barriers, challenges, and accessibility initiatives by the city and local tourism groups, accessible public transportation in New Orleans, accessibility and event planning for the 2025 Super Bowl, and long-standing tourism events in New Orleans and plans for implementing the final guidelines for public right-of-way and shared use paths in the City of New Orleans. The week-long meetings with stakeholders support Objective 4.1 and 4.2, and the July 2025 Board Meeting will continue in achieving these objectives through engagement with stakeholders in roundtables, panel presentations, discussions, site tours, and demonstrations.

At the July Board meeting, the Board voted for the 2026 out-of-town meeting and town hall to take place in Providence, Rhode Island. Possible events and meetings include a panel discussion on beach and outdoor area accessibility; an accessible art experience and panel discussion on disability in the arts at The Steel Yard; a visit to a state veterans’ home and discussion with veterans with disabilities; an “accessibility walk” to view accessibility issues and solutions in the public right-of-way; a visit to a cafe designed to be used by employees with disabilities; and a meeting with state officials to understand efforts to improve accessibility in Rhode Island. The 2026 out-of-town meeting and town hall will support Objective 4.1 and 4.2.






#### Presentations

To achieve Objectives 4.1 and 4.2, Access Board staff also provided presentations and engaged with stakeholders outside the context of Board Meetings and the agency’s (co-)hosted public events.  Agency staff were featured speakers or panelists at both government and industry conferences, forums, symposiums, and other public events to discuss accessible design and accessibility. Examples include, but not limited to, GSA’s 2022 Interagency Accessibility Forum, Administration for Community Living 2023 National Title VI Training & Technical Assistance Conference, M-Enabling Summit, Mid-Atlantic ADA Conference, ADA National Network Directors Meeting, and California State University, Northridge (CSUN) Annual Assistive Technology Conference.  These presentations span a range of topics in both the built environment and Section 508.

In pursuant of EOs 13175 and 13985, Board staff presented in May 2023 at IHS’s Tribal Leaders and Urban Indian Organization Leaders meeting, whose primary audience were Tribal leaders and those serving Tribal communities. Agency staff presented on the agency’s history, statutory authority, services and programs, and outreach.  In July 2023, Access Board staff also presented in person at IHS’s Office of Environmental Health and Engineering Facilities Directors quarterly meeting in Rapid City, SD. Agency staff also received a tour of the new Rapid City Health Center facility, providing technical assistance on accessibility of the facility.

Agency technical staff engaged with a wide array of federal agencies, including representatives from the NPS, FEMA, DOT’s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Federal Transit Administration, the Federal Highway Administration, Department of Labor’s ODEP, DOJ, HHS, and the Food and Drug Administration.  In addition, and as noted above, Board staff maintain partnerships and collaborations with Amtrak, state and local departments of transportation, and codes and standards organization officials, from such organizations as RESNA, ICC, and ASTM.

#### Notable Meetings

Objectives 4.1 and 4.2 were developed for alignment with EOs 13175 *Memorandum on Tribal Consultation and Strengthening Nation-to-Nation Relationships*, 13985 *Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government*, and 14035 *Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce*.  The agency has worked toward achieving the mission of EO 13175 by meeting with other federal agencies, such as Administration for Community Living, IHS, and HHS’s Indian Health Services to discuss the Access Board’s services and programs and strategize ways to build and improve relationships with Tribal communities and employees. Additionally, the agency met with community members and organizations serving Tribal members, including Disability Rights CA, National Congress of American Indians, and Southeast ADA Center, to name a few.  In continuing to achieve Objective 4.1 during FY 2024, the Access Board will seek out opportunities to connect with federal agencies focused on serving Tribal Nations and to establish relationships with Tribal communities.

Internationally, Board staff met with officials and delegates to discuss the agency’s guidelines and standards, education on and promotion of accessible design and accessibility, and U.S. laws related to accessibility.  In FY 2023, the Access Board convened with international representatives in the Department of State’s International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP), a premier professional exchange program that brings together foreign leaders and American counterparts to engage on emerging issues, policy goals, and shared interests.  These meetings involved IVLP groups with representatives from: Mongolia to discuss federal laws and standards, practices to promote accessibility throughout society, and long-term collaboration and partnership opportunities; Korea to learn about the Board’s accessibility guidelines and standards, regulations and rules, technical assistance services, and efforts to make environments accessible for people with disabilities.; Middle East and North Africa to discuss federal, state, and local laws and disability policies; Moldova to discuss sustainable cities, accessible design, Section 508, ADA, and ABA; Peru to discuss adaptive sports equipment and accessibility in higher education; and Indonesia to inclusive education for students with disabilities, integrated classrooms, disability-specific curriculum, and DEIA in the U.S.

Board technical staff also continued participating in the European eAccessibility working group to assist in developing a European standard to make ICT products and services accessible.  During June 2023, Board Executive Director and senior staff met with a European Commission delegation of three representatives to discuss ongoing work on the European Accessibility Act (EAA) and to share information and resources related to the Access Board’s work with accessibility standards and guidelines.  In July 2023, Board Executive Director presented opening remarks to an international audience of over 500 participants at the launch of the European Commission’s new Resource Center on Accessibility.

#### Public Communication

The Access Board has several external communication channels to provide information on accessibility guidelines and standards, services and programs, news updates, and accessible design resources.  These channels provide possibilities for underserved communities to be informed and supported in redressing inequities throughout society (Objective 4.1) and for all members of the public to understand barriers to accessibility beyond the Access Board's guidelines and standards (Objective 4.2).
