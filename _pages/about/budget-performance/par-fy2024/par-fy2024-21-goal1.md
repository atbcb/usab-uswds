## Goal #1: Establish Technical Specifications for Accessible Design

The Access Board's first strategic goal is supported by five objectives, which are:

- Objective 1.1: Develop and update technical specifications to achieve accessibility.
- Objective 1.2: Coordinate with standards and codes organizations to build effective industry accessibility standards.
- Objective 1.3: Engage with the public, including underserved communities, to inform the development of accessible design.
- Objective 1.4: Address accessibility of emerging technologies and design trends.
- Objective 1.5: Collaborate with organizations to encourage research on accessibility.

### Background

In its mission and under its statutory authority, the Access Board develops and maintains accessibility standards and guidelines, and Goal #1 establishes objectives that direct Board staff and operations to complete such work.  The Access Board is responsible for developing and maintaining accessibility criteria for the built environment, transportation vehicles, ICT, medical diagnostic equipment, and outdoor recreational areas under the Americans with Disability Act (ADA), the ABA, and Sections 508 and 510 of the Rehabilitation Act.  In general, the Access Board has regulatory authority for two different types of accessibility criteria: (1) accessibility "guidelines," which only have force of law when formally adopted through regulation by an enforcing entity --- typically, another federal agency; and (2) accessibility "standards," which have force of law upon issuance.  For example, under the ADA, the Departments of Justice (DOJ) and Transportation (DOT) are obliged to use the Access Board's ADA Accessibility Guidelines as the baseline for implementing their regulations addressing public accommodations and transportation vehicles, respectively.

However, until these departments promulgate final regulations, the ADA Accessibility Guidelines are not legally enforceable.  By contrast, under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Access Board is charged with issuing technical and functional performance standards for the accessibility of ICT that federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use, and these standards are enforceable upon promulgation by the Access Board.  Technical standards for medical diagnostic equipment issued under Section 510 of the Rehabilitation Act, part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, are voluntary in nature.  Federal agencies are not required to adopt these standards, but they may adopt the standards as mandatory requirements under the ADA.

### Summary of Key Accomplishments in FY 2024

#### Accessibility Standards for Medical Diagnostic Equipment

The Access Board issued its accessibility standards for medical diagnostic equipment (MDE) in 2017.  These standards address access to examination tables and chairs, weight scales, radiological equipment, and other equipment used by health care providers for diagnostic purposes.  The standards specify that MDE transfer surfaces be adjustable across a specified range so that they can be aligned with the seat of a patient's wheelchair to facilitate transfer to the equipment.  The Access Board proposed that transfer surfaces be adjustable from a low height of 17 inches to a high height of 25 inches based on a major study it helped sponsor on measures of people who use wheeled mobility aids.  There was strong disagreement among commenters and stakeholders on what the low transfer height should be.  Disability advocates supported the 17-inch minimum recommended by the anthropometric study, while MDE manufactures alleged that this height would be difficult and expensive to meet and that low height from 17 inches to 19 inches should be allowed, consistent with existing access standards and industry practice.  In finalizing the MDE standards, the Access Board specified a temporary low transfer surface height range of 17 to 19 inches pending the collection of further information and research.  This provision expired in January 2022. 

In FY 2021, the Access Board commissioned a study to further analyze wheelchair seat height.  This study was completed in January 2022.  In May 2022, the Access Board held an informational virtual public meeting on the study so that members of the public had an opportunity to comment on the study and the finalizing of the low transfer height provision of the MDE Standards.  The Access Board also received, and has reviewed, more than 100 written comments regarding the study and low transfer height.  In the meantime, the Access Board issued a Direct Final Rule in February 2022 to extend, for an additional three years, the provision in the 2017 guidelines on low transfer height that had expired.

In FY 2023, the Access Board published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), setting the low transfer height at 17 inches on May 23, 2023 [(88 FR 33056)](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-10827).  The public comment period closed on August 31, 2023, and 77 comments were received.

In FY 2024, the Access Board published a final rule, setting the low transfer height at 17 inches on July 25, 2024 [(89 FR 60307)](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-16266).

#### Self-Service Transaction Machines

Kiosks and other types of self-service transaction machines (SSTMs) are now a common feature in places of public accommodation, state and local government facilities (such as motor vehicle departments), and other buildings and facilities.  SSTMs are used to conduct an expanding range of transactions and functions, including use as point-of-sales machines for self-checkout in a growing number of retail facilities, grocery stores, and drug stores.

However, kiosks and SSTMs have long posed accessibility barriers to people with disabilities, particularly those who are blind or have low vision.  Robust speech output is necessary to provide access for users unable to see display screens.  SSTMs also can pose barriers for users who are deaf or hard of hearing if they lack captioning and text equivalents for audible information.  Furthermore, these devices must be accessible to people with physical disabilities, including those who use wheelchairs and other mobility devices, have limited dexterity, or who are of short stature.

As part of its work for Objective 1.4, the Access Board has devoted attention to these emerging technologies and ubiquitous trends.  In FY 2023, the agency issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) on supplemental accessibility guidelines for SSTMs, seeking public comment on the Boards anticipated approach to accessibility guidelines for these devices. 

In FY 2024, Board staff drafted an NPRM proposing technical accessibility specifications for SSTMs, as well as specific scoping for SSTMs in buildings and sites, public rights-of-way, and transportation vehicles. In addition, Board staff, with the assistance of a contractor, prepared the preliminary regulatory impact analysis for this rulemaking. The Board approved the rulemaking package for submission to OMB, where it is currently under review.  The Access Board anticipates publication of the NPRM in December 2024.

#### Electric Vehicle Charging Stations

The Access Board also worked to achieve Objective 1.4 by attending to electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and accessibility. EV charging stations are becoming commonplace with the rising production and use of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, there are nearly 50,000 public EV charging stations with almost 127,000 charging ports across the country. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which President Biden signed into law in November 2021, allocates $7.5 billion to build out a national network of 500,000 EV chargers to accelerate the adoption of EVs.

In July 2022, the Access Board released the Technical Assistance Document “Design Recommendations for Accessible Electric Vehicle Charging Stations.” The document identifies some already existing requirements applicable to facilities generally in the ADA Accessibility Guidelines, which have been adopted as enforceable standards by DOJ, and the ABA Accessibility Standards.

During FY 2023, the Access Board worked on a rulemaking to supplement the ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines to address access to EV charging stations, supporting Objective 1.1 and 1.4.  The Access Board entered into an interagency agreement with DOT’s Volpe Center, which has prepared a preliminary regulatory impact analysis (evaluating the costs and benefits of the proposed rule), and initial regulatory flexibility analysis (which considers the impact of the rule on small businesses).

During FY 2024, the Access Board completed EO 12866 review and published the notice of proposed rulemaking on September 3, 2024 [89 FR 71215](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-18820).  The public comment period ended on November 4, 2024.

#### Update of Existing ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Rail Vehicles

The Access Board continues to work in the area of transportation and achieve Objective 1.1.  In FY 2022, the agency published an ANPRM to begin the process of updating its existing accessibility guidelines for rail vehicles covered by the ADA.  The Access Board received over 200 public comments, which were evaluated and analyzed in preparation for the proposed rule.

ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Rail Vehicles will be addressed with an NPRM in 2023. The NPRM will address and incorporate comments received in response to the ANPRM and recommendations from the Access Board's Rail Vehicles Access Advisory Committee (RVAAC).  The advisory committee, whose members included representatives from advocacy organizations, transit operators, rail car manufacturers, and other stakeholders, reviewed the existing rail car guidelines and identified areas that need to be updated because of accessibility issues, advances in technology, changes in car design, and other factors.  Recommendations from the committee address rail car communications, boarding and alighting, on-board circulation, seating, and rooms and spaces.

The Access Board intends to publish an NPRM setting forth ADA Accessibility Guidelines for rail vehicles in June 2025.  The NPRM will address and incorporate comments received in response to the ANPRM and recommendations from the advisory committee.

#### Board and Staff Participation in Development of Voluntary Consensus Standards

To contribute to the achievement of Objectives 1.2, 1.4, and 1.5, Access Board staff also serve on numerous committees, technical working groups, and cooperative research panels to ensure that the agency's technical expertise and perspective are brought to bear on the development (or revision) of model codes and standards that affect accessibility in a wide range of settings, including such areas as: the built environment; recreational facilities; websites and web content; public transportation technologies; and traffic control devices.

In FY 2024, staff served on, or worked with, the following model code groups, standard-setting organizations, and research cooperatives, including:
-   American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) Committee on Sports Equipment, Playing Surfaces, and Facilities;
-   International Code Council (ICC) Consensus Committee on Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities (ANSI A117.1);
