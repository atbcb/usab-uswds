## Stewardship Objective: Improve Agency Systems and Modernize Operations

The Access Board's stewardship objective/goal is supported by three objectives, which are:

- Objective 5.1: Use data and technology to enhance operations and services.
- Objective 5.2: Use tools and internal systems to consolidate and retain agency knowledge.
- Objective 5.3: Update agency policies, procedures, and administrative regulations.

### Background

The Modernizing Government Technology Act delivers a clear mandate to federal agencies to look for ways to increase efficiency and effectiveness and improve service to the public.  The Access Board requires centralized identity management systems for agency users that can be integrated into applications and common platforms. IT resources are critical in support of the Access Board's strategic objective to improve agency systems and modernize operations. The overall goal of the Access Board, in accordance with recent and ongoing IT mandates, is to create a common environment for enterprise platform standards, processes, and governance, modernize legacy agency equipment, and secure and enhance the IT infrastructure.

### Summary of Key Accomplishments in FY 2023

#### IT Modernization

In FY 2023, the agency continued its IT modernization efforts with the adoption of new technologies, tools, and best practices in order to support its Stewardship Objective.  Key accomplishments include the deployment of the Continuous Monitoring Tools to add additional endpoint detection and response capabilities to all agency assets for more visibility from alerting.  The Access Board has also migrated all cyber policies to the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) 500-53 Rev 5.  The cyber team also conducted a monthly Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M) to track assorted items around risk management.  The transition of Continuous Diagnostic Monitoring (CDM) has brought greater value to the Access Board’s ability to maintain a good cyber security posture.  CDM has helped in many areas, including asset management, risk management, vulnerability management, Agency-Wide Adaptive Risk Enumeration (AWARE) scores and FISMA metrics.  The Access Board can now track Binding Operational Directives and Emergency Directives more efficiently while staying up to date with the latest cyber security threats.  All of this work supports Objective 5.1.

The Access Board has made great progress to fully modernize mobile device management. Device management is a critical component of the Access Board’s security strategy.  It helps ensure that mobile devices are secure, updated, and compliant with agency policies, with the goal of protecting the network and data from unauthorized access.  Implementations, such as Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), full enablement of Personal Identity Verification (PIV), and Zero trust architecture, are moving toward completion.

In FY 2023, the Access Board has also completed the migration to Palo Alto security devices and has identified and implemented an alternate identity management solution.

#### Updated Policies

To support Objective 5.3, the Access Board revised numerous human resources policies that were out-of-date and created some new policies where none had previously existed, such as:

- In October 2022, the Access Board issued an anti-harassment policy to prevent and eliminate harassment in the workplace. This policy replaces an interim policy issued in 2021;
- In October 2022, the Access Board issued a policy describing the EEO process, including how employees can make EEO counselor contact prior to a formal complaint of employment discrimination, and how complaints will be handled;
- In February 2023, the EEOC approved the Access Board’s policy on providing reasonable accommodation for employees and applicants with disabilities;
- In February 2023, the Access Board issued a personnel security policy in accordance with FISMA; and
- In September 2023, the Access Board issued an updated time and attendance policy governing time and attendance to effectively manage work hours and leave.

Finally, the Access Board has been working to enhance and update its Privacy program to include working closely with the IT group to enhance procedures for privacy incidents and breaches, including issuing a Breach Response Policy, Training and Awareness Policy, and a Breach Response Procedure, all of which were implemented in October 2022.
