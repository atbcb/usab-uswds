## Goal #3: Improve the Accessibility of the Federal Government

The Access Board's third strategic goal is supported by three objectives, which are:

- Objective 3.1: Improve the accessibility of federal buildings and facilities through enhanced awareness and robust enforcement of the Architectural Barriers Act.
- Objective 3.2: Improve accessibility of federal information and communication technology through collaboration with other federal agencies.
- Objective 3.3: Be a model employer of persons with disabilities.

### Background

Improving the accessibility of the federal government is a foundational pillar of the Access Board's mission. The agency was established by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to be the sole agency responsible for the enforcement of the ABA. The ABA requires most buildings designed, constructed, altered, or leased by the federal government---along with certain other federally-financed facilities---to be accessible to, and usable by, persons with disabilities. The agency's ABA enforcement program processes and investigates complaints and, when violations are found, works with the appropriate federal agency or facility owner/leaseholder to remedy these barriers. In any given year, the Access Board receives ABA complaints concerning a wide range of federal buildings and facilities, such as office buildings, service centers, post offices, national parks, military facilities, Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers, and courthouses. Enforcement program staff also work proactively with federal agencies and others to ensure that relevant officials at headquarters, regional and field offices, and local sites have a working knowledge of their accessibility obligations. The Access Board has cultivated productive working relationships with senior leaders at its sister federal agencies, particularly those that own, manage, or lease federal properties or see frequent ABA complaints.

While the Access Board continues to successfully execute its ABA-related mandates, its responsibilities have expanded significantly during its nearly 50-year history.  One such duty includes ensuring that ICT is accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, as required by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Federal agencies must develop, procure, maintain, and use ICT that is accessible. This ensures equal access to federal employment for people with disabilities and reduces the need for agencies to undertake individual accommodations. In addition, this ensures that members of the public who are individuals with disabilities will have access to government information and services. The Access Board is undertaking initiatives in partnership with other federal agencies to promote and advance ICT accessibility throughout the federal sector.

In all of its work, the Access Board seeks to remove barriers to equity and inclusion for, and increase the dignity and respect of, individuals with disabilities. But the Access Board acknowledges that these outward, public-facing endeavors cannot succeed if it does not also focus its efforts on its own employees. As such, the Access Board continuously strives to be a model employer of people with disabilities in all phases of the employment life cycleâ€”from recruitment and hiring, to retention and advancement.

In EO 14035 *Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce* (June 2021) (the "DEIA Executive Order"), President Biden highlighted accessibility as one of the great equalizers which, among other things, leads to a stronger and more effective workforce and affords individuals with disabilities an equitable and inclusive work environment. The Access Board's work squarely supports this philosophy.

### Summary of Key Accomplishments in FY 2022

#### ABA Enforcement

To achieve Objective 3.1 during FY 2022, the Access Board received 241 new ABA complaints and closed 197 pending complaints. The total number of ABA complaints filed this year represented a nearly 34% increase relative to complaints filed in the prior fiscal year (FY 2021). This large increase is in some ways deceiving, because many more "spam" complaints were filed in FY 2022 than usual, for reasons the Access Board cannot explain. Nonetheless, as shown in Table 1, there has been an upward trend in filings since FY 2020. Stringent pandemic-related restrictions during that fiscal year have since been relaxed, and the Access Board believes this allowed more Americans to return to frequenting post offices and other federal facilities, thereby increasing the opportunity for individuals to encounter (and report) architectural barriers.

Presented below in Table 1 are ABA caseload statistics for FY 2022, as well as comparative data for FYs 2020 and 2021. (***Note:*** All tabular data provided in this section about ABA cases were compiled from the Access Board's cloud-based Complaint Tracking System [CTS], which is the official repository of all ABA complaint files.)

##### Table 1: ABA Caseload Statistics (FYs 2020-2022)

| ABA Cases | FY 2020 | FY 2021 | FY 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Complaints Pending (start of fiscal year) | 104 | 77* | 83 |
| Complaints Received | 140 | 180 | 241 |
| Complaints Closed (during fiscal year) | 140 | 180 | 241 |

***Note:*** Due to a typographical error, in last year's report the agency incorrectly noted that there were 167 ABA complaints pending at the start of FY 2021; the correct number, 77, is reflected in Table 1.

Of the 197 ABA cases closed this year, about 23% (45 cases) were closed after the federal agency (or other facility owner/leaseholder) took corrective action to remedy building elements or features determined by the agency's investigative findings to be ABA violations under the applicable accessibility standard. This figure represents an 18.4% increase compared to cases closed in the prior fiscal year (FY 2021) following corrective action. The increase is partly explained by the fact that three U.S. Postal Service facilities each had two ABA complaints with similar allegations lodged against them, and corrective action projects completed in FY 2021 at those three facilities accounted for the closure of six complaints total. Also, four longstanding complaints concerning facilities of the General Services Administration---mentioned below---that had timelines for corrective action affected by pandemic-related delays in FY 2021 were all resolved in FY 2022.

In brief, the ABA closed cases this year that resulted in corrective action can be broken down into three broad categories by facility type:

- **Defense-related and Veterans Facilities**: The Access Board successfully resolved 7 ABA complaints against the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, including cases relating to the Family Camp, an Air Force Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) facility, at Travis Air Force Base, California; the Roudebush VA Medical Center in Indianapolis, Indiana; Naval Station Norfolk; and the D.C. Armory (home of the D.C. National Guard).

- **Post Offices**: The Access Board successfully resolved 31 ABA complaints relating to U.S. Postal Service facilities, with major remedial work completed for post offices in Cave Junction, Oregon; Winnsboro, South Carolina; Seattle, Washington (two locations); Hickory, North Carolina; and Keller, Texas.

- **Other ABA-Covered Facilities:** The Access Board also successfully resolved 5 ABA complaints relating to facilities owned or leased by the General Services Administration (the Region 6 Headquarters Building in Kansas City, Missouri; the Peckham Federal Building in San Jose, California; the Denver Federal Center in Lakewood, Colorado; and Social Security Administration offices in Culpeper, Virginia, and Reading, Pennsylvania). In addition, the agency resolved complaints against the U.S. Forest Service (the Sundew Campground in the Plumas National Forest, Meadow Valley, California) and the Thomas Day House in Milton, North Carolina---where the Access Board had jurisdiction since a prior renovation of the historic site used federal grant funds from DOI, and where the governing board installed an entrance ramp in response to the ABA complaint.

The balance of ABA cases closed this year---or 77%---were concluded for a range of technical or administrative reasons. Most involved referring complainants to other federal agencies because the agency lacked ABA jurisdiction over the matters raised in the complaint. In FY 2022, the Access Board mainly referred complainants to DOJ (complaints related to ADA-covered state or local facilities or places of public accommodation) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (claims relating to apartment buildings covered by the Fair Housing Act). (Note: for many years the Access Board's practice for referrals was to simply provide complainants with information on how to file their non-ABA complaints with the appropriate agency.)

But, in an effort to lessen the burden on these individuals, in FY 2022 the Access Board slowly began implementing a process to forward the complaint directly to the correct agency, after obtaining complainants' permission to disclose their identities. The Access Board will expand this implementation during FY 2023 until the point at which it becomes a standard operating procedure. Many ABA complaints were closed in FY 2022 for administrative reasons, ranging from unintelligibility or "spam" filings to complaints that provide insufficient detail to discern the nature of the allegations or to allow enforcement staff to contact the complainant to gather additional/clarifying information.

Finally, a small number of complaints were closed because the agency determined, after conducting its investigation, that the Access Board lacked jurisdiction (because, for example, the building was built prior to 1968 and not altered since, and so not covered by the ABA) or that the complaint allegations did not constitute ABA violations (because, for example, a building inspection revealed that the element at issue did in fact meet the minimum scoping requirements or technical specifications in the ABA standards).

Table 2 below provides data for ABA cases closed in FY 2022 by reason for case closure.

##### Table 2: Reasons for ABA Case Closures (FY 2022)

| Basis for ABA Case Closure | # Cases | % of All Closed Cases <br /> (FY 2022) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Corrective action taken/accessibility barriers addressed  | 45 | 22.8 |
| No ABA jurisdiction | 9 | 4.6 |
| Investigation found no ABA violation | 13 | 6.6 |
| Waiver/modification issued by standard-setting agency | 0 | 0 |
| Referral to another federal agency | 72 | 36.5 |
| Administrative closure | 58 | 29.4 |

Aside from ABA enforcement, Objective 3.1 also addresses enhancing awareness of the ABA and the Access Board's enforcement role. The DEIA Executive Order, among other things, requires the Access Board to work with agencies to ensure that their facilities not only comply with the ABA and related standards, but also go beyond those legal requirements to maximize the accessibility of agency workplaces. The EO also requires that agencies provide periodic notice to their employees that ABA complaints can be filed with the Access Board. In FY 2022, the Access Board conducted important outreach to agencies by publishing a resource on its website to aid agencies in developing the accessibility portions of their DEIA strategic plans. The resource, "Recommendations and Resources to Assist Agencies in Identifying and Advancing Priorities for Facility Accessibility," was distributed to agencies government-wide by OPM on March 4, 2022. The Access Board also continues to conduct webinars and trainings and provide technical assistance on the accessibility of the federal workspace, with specific webinars on the topic being presented in April 2022 and scheduled for November 2022.

In its Equity Action Plan, published on January 20, 2022, as required by EO 13985 *Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government* (Jan. 2021), the Access Board set forth aims for ensuring that its ABA enforcement program considers the needs and rights of historically underserved communities with high incidences of disability. During FY 2022, the Access Board held leadership meetings with the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs at the Department of the Interior to galvanize its effort to establish a procedure for evaluating the accessibility of facilities of the Bureaus of Indian Affairs, Indian Education, and Trust Fund Administration---where in-person services are provided to American Indians and Alaska Natives. The Access Board also began collecting data from the Census Bureau and Social Security Administration to guide us in identifying the specific communities in the country with the highest incidence of disability, which the agency plans to cross-reference with the facility inventories of the U.S. Postal Service and General Services Administration to identify specific facilities (where in-person services are provided) for accessibility assessments. The Access Board plans to continue and expand upon these efforts in FY 2023.

The Access Board continues to publicize results from its ABA enforcement program (specifically, on completed corrective actions) on its website and social media accounts, and in FY 2023 will finally complete and disseminate long-planned videos on the ABA, its enforcement role, and the process for complaint filing.

During FY 2022, the Access Board also devoted a significant amount of time to selecting and setting up a new cloud-based complaint tracking system that is more efficient and cost-effective than the version the agency has been using for the past decade. That new system was implemented at the beginning of FY 2023.

Of the four ABA standard-setting agencies, only the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has not yet adopted our ABA Accessibility Standards (ABAAS), which were promulgated in 2004. HUD still uses an older accessibility standard from 1984---the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS)---as the basis for evaluating housing accessibility under the ABA and Rehabilitation Act of 1973. According to its Spring 2022 Semiannual Regulatory Agenda, HUD planned to issue a proposed rule to update and improve its ABA standards applicable to residential structures subject to the ABA by September 2022 (<https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202204&RIN=2529-AB04>).

#### Accessible Federal Information and Communication Technology

In FY 2022, the Board staff continued to provide webinars, training, and guidance to federal agencies on Section 508 standards and requirements, oftentimes collaborating with other federal agencies and staff (Objective 3.2). Under the DEIA Executive Order, the Access Board has partnered with the General Administration Services, OPM, and OMB to promote best practices, resources, and guidance for federal agencies in ensuring access to ICT in the federal workplace. The Access Board conducted a webinar with General Administration Services in July 2022 that showcased the resources developed to implement DEIA in the federal government. The Access Board also presented a webinar in April 2022 addressing digital and physical accessibility in the federal workplace environment and is scheduled for a webinar in November 2022. Additionally, the Access Board has provided technical assistance to federal agencies in addressing accessibility of ICT in their DEIA strategic plans during FY 2022. Finally, the Access Board will be part of a "virtual summit" on DEIA hosted by OPM in FY 2023.

#### Model Employer of Persons with Disabilities

As underscored by the DEIA Executive Order, the federal government, as the Nation's largest employer, has a special responsibility to lead by example in including people with disabilities in the workforce.  The Access Board prides itself on its history of inclusiveness in employment. It is part of who the Access Board is as an agency, and it will continue this effort as it moves forward to be a model employer of people with disabilities (Objective 3.3).

In FY 2022, the Access Board took steps to ensure that leaders at all levels promote the vision for DEIA. The agency implemented a new performance standard for supervisors and managers that focuses on employee career development and the cultivation of an inclusive, constructive work environment that is committed to EEO policies and principles and is based on transparent communication, mutual trust, and respect.Â 

During late FY 2022, the Access Board contracted with a leading diversity and inclusion consulting business to assist in its internal implementation of the DEIA Executive Order for its workforce. Plans are underway to provide internal staff training, to facilitate interactive conversations on the benefits of diversity, and to expand the agency's strategies for delivering services to more diverse and underserved members of the public.

In an effort to seek qualified student candidates with disabilities, during FY 2022, the Access Board registered with the Workforce Recruitment Program (WRP), which helps federal employers hire people with disabilities for internships or permanent jobs, and Handshake (a hiring platform that allows employers to share employment opportunities with colleges and universities across the country).

Additionally, the Access Board maintains a file of "Schedule A" applicants that is reviewed prior to the posting of agency vacancies. Schedule A provides a means for agencies to hire qualified people with disabilities outside of the usual process for hiring into the competitive service. Individuals with disabilities may be hired into "excepted service" positions and then converted to the competitive service after having demonstrated successful job performance over a period of time.
