The Access Board is an independent federal agency that promotes equality for people with disabilities through leadership in accessible design and the development of accessibility guidelines and standards.  Created in 1973 to ensure access to federally funded facilities, the Board is now a leading source of information on accessible design.  The Board develops and maintains design criteria for the built environment, transit vehicles, information and communication technology, and medical diagnostic equipment under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and other laws. It also provides technical assistance and training on these requirements and enforces accessibility standards that apply to federally funded facilities under the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA).

The Access Board is a micro-agency with a maximum of 30 full-time employees when fully staffed and 13 presidentially appointed part-time special government employees who serve as the Public members on the agency’s Board.  This report contains data and analysis concerning equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint activity at the Access Board.  For fiscal year 2024 the Access Board had no complaints filed.
