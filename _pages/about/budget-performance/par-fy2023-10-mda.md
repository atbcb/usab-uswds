## Management Discussion and Analysis

### Mission

Established by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the United States Access Board --- which was then known as the "Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board" --- is an independent federal agency devoted to advancing accessibility and equality for people with disabilities.&nbsp;
Originally, in the mid-1970s, the Access Board’s primary mission was enforcement of the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA), which requires federal buildings and certain other federally financed facilities to be accessible to persons with disabilities.&nbsp;
Congress has, however, expanded the agency’s mission and responsibilities over the years.&nbsp;
Today, the Access Board’s mission embraces frour main areas: development of accessibility criteria for the built environment and other matters as directed by Congress (e.g., transit vehicles, information and communication technology, telecommunications equipment, medical diagnostic equipment); training and technical assistance; ABA compliance and enforcement, and promotion of accessibility.

### Organizational Structure

The Access Board is governed by a 25-member board, with the Board Chair serving as agency head.&nbsp;
Figure 1 depicts the agency's organizational structure in FY 2023.

### Board Members

The agency's 25-member Governing Board acts as a coordinating body among senior officials from twelve federal agencies (referred to as "Federal Members") and thirteen presidentially-appointed members of the general public (referred to as "Public Members"), a majority of whom must be persons with disabilities.

Agency heads have the discretion to designate their agencies’ respective Federal Member so long as such members are drawn from the ranks of senior-level appointees (i.e., officials whose positions are compensated on the Executive Schedule at Level IV or higher).  As such, the “terms” of Federal Members have no pre-determined length.  Public Members, on the other hand, are appointed for staggered, 4-year terms with the possibility of one successive reappointment term.  Public Members serve as Special Government Employees (SGEs) and, when performing their official duties, are paid at Executive Schedule Level IV. 

Under the Access Board’s bylaws, the Board meets quarterly, with one of its Board Meetings annually taking place outside the Washington, D.C. area.  The Governing Board is led by a Chair and Vice-Chair, each of whom are elected by majority vote of their fellow Board members and serve one-year terms. To foster a balance of interests, the Chair and Vice-Chair must alternate annually between Federal and Public Members, such that, when the Chair is a Federal Member, the Vice-Chair is a Public Member and vice-versa.  The Board Chair (or his or her written delegee) act on the agency’s behalf matters reserved for agency heads under federal law or regulation.

### Staff Offices

The Access Board's career staff is organized into four units/offices.  At the close of FY 2023, the agency had 27 full-time employees --- most of whom are professionals with subject-matter expertise in accessibility matters within the Access Board’s jurisdiction.  The agency’s physical office is in Washington, D.C. at 1331 F St. NW, Suite 1000.

#### Office of the Executive Director

The Office of the Executive Director (OED) is responsible for providing overall administrative leadership of the agency.  The Executive Director, who is appointed by the Governing Board, oversees the day-to-day operation of the agency by, among other things, setting agency-wide priorities and overseeing their performance, supervising agency personnel, ensuring that the budget is administered effectively and efficiently, coordinating Governing Board meetings, and representing the Access Board on inter-agency committees and other official events.

In addition, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 tasks the Executive Director with directing the Access Board’s ABA compliance and enforcement program, including, when needed, the issuance of formal citations (which initiate formal administrative proceedings when ABA complaints cannot be resolved voluntarily) and filing of civil actions to enforce final orders.  OED also directs the agency’s public affairs program, including managing its external communications, handling media relations, directing outreach activities and serving as point of contact for legislative affairs. 

#### Office of Technical and Information Services

The Office of Technical and Information Services (OTIS) leads the agency’s development of accessibility guidelines and standards for the built environment, public right-of-way, transportation vehicles, information and communication technology (ICT), and medical diagnostic equipment.  OTIS provides technical assistance and guidance to the public on these guidelines and standards.  It also conducts webinars and training on accessibility and manages some of the Access Board’s communication with the public, such as through the agency’s website.

#### Office of General Counsel

The Office of General Counsel (OGC) provides legal expertise and counsel to Board Members and staff regarding the work and operations of the agency, including matters relating to Access Board's jurisdiction or authorities and the development of agency regulatory initiatives.  OGC also manages the agency’s ethics, Freedom of Information Act, and privacy programs and oversees the Access Board’s ABA Compliance and Enforcement program.  As the agency’s legal officers, OGC attorneys may represent the agency in administrative proceedings and, where permitted by statute, in civil actions in federal and state courts that arise under the ABA or Section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act.

#### Office of Administration

The Office of Administration (OA) coordinates and manages administrative support activities for the Access Board.  OA’s support includes the areas of human resources (HR), budget and finance, records management, and information technology (IT) operations and support.  Due to its small size, the Access Board has an inter-agency agreement with the Treasury Department’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service/Administrative Resource Center (BFS/ARC) for financial management, HR, procurement, and travel services.  OA is responsible for overseeing, and coordinating with, BFS/ARC as our shared services provider.  Although the Access Board is a “non-CFO” agency, OA employs a Financial Program Manager to oversee the agency’s finances and financial reports.

### Controls, Systems, and Legal Compliance

The Access Board recognizes that maintaining integrity and accountability in its financial systems, programs, and operations is critical for good government, demonstrates responsible stewardship over assets and resources, helps ensure high-quality and responsible leadership, allows for effective delivery of services to customers, and maximizes desired program outcomes.

As a small, independent federal agency, Access Board leadership has found that it is effective to obtain various administrative services (e.g., financial management, human resources, procurement, travel, and Equal Employment Opportunity \[EEO] services) from federal shared service providers than develop in-house capabilities for these services.  With respect to financial management systems, the Access Board relies heavily on the systems, controls, and assurances provided by BFS/ARC to meet applicable legal requirements, including Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines.  In addition, the Access Board supplements BFS/ARC’s controls with its own internal control processes to ensure the propriety of agency spending, as well as the validity of financial and performance data.  Collectively, the Access Board believes that these measures sufficiently ensure that the performance and financial data included in this report are accurate, reliable, and complete.

#### Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FMFIA)

The objective of the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FMFIA) is to ensure that agencies have internal controls and financial systems in place that provide reasonable assurance of the effectiveness and efficiency of operations, reliability of financial reporting, and compliance with regulations and applicable laws. To that end, the FMFIA, as implemented, requires agencies to establish internal control processes consistent with guidelines established by OMB and the Comptroller General.  Agency heads must annually attest --- via a written assurance statement --- whether the agency does or does not comply with applicable FMFIA requirements.

During FY 2023, the Access Board had several interagency agreements with other federal agencies for shared administrative services.  The Access Board contracted with BFS/ARC for financial management, HR, procurement, and travel services.  Other shared service included:  the General Services Administration (GSA) for internet, voice communication, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card administration, and web hosting; the Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Financial Center (NFC) for payroll; the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) Interior Business Center for HR security and drug testing; the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for employee relations consulting services, performance management program system; the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) for background investigations services; and the United States Postal Service (USPS) for EEO complaint investigation).

With respect to financial management and payroll systems, certain aspects of the Access Board’s financial management system are largely influenced by the controls, practices, and procedures employed by BFS/ARC and NFC.  Each has established practices and procedures that assure appropriate internal controls.

BFS/ARC’s financial management system is audited annually for compliance with Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) 18, and the Access Board receives quarterly SSAE 18 SOC 1 Type II Reports on the ongoing effectiveness of the system’s internal controls.  Likewise, NFC annually provides its customers/stakeholders with a written statement of assurance concerning the effectiveness of its financial reporting controls.

Moreover, the Access Board has implemented its own internal controls and procedures to complement the measures employed by its shared service providers. For example, the Access Board’s Finacial Program Manager reviews and reconciles financial reports from BFS/ARC quarterly to ensure that the agency’s obligations and disbursements have been properly recorded; additionally, year-end financial statements are reviewed to verify they are correct and accurate.  Agency procedure also requires the Finacial Program Manager to prospectively certify funds availability for all obligations.  In addition, the Finacial Program Manager and Director of OA conduct periodic reviews of internal systems, including travel, payroll, and procurement.  Lastly, the Access Board’s financial statements undergo annual audits by an independent accountant, which include review of the adequacy of its internal control systems.

For these reasons, the Access Board can provide reasonable assurance that internal controls over financial reporting are operating effectively and that there are no material weaknesses relating to the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting.

#### Financial Statement Audit

Under the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002 (codified at 31 U.S.C. § 3515), most small agencies, such as the Access Board, are required to have their financial statements audited annually. As such, the Access Board’s financial statements have undergone an audit annually by independent accountants, including reviews of the adequacy of its control systems.

#### Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA)

In 2020, the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) became law. The PIIA repealed the prior statutory regime and established new requirements concerning federal agency obligations to prevent, identify, and annually report on improper payments (e.g., payment of incorrect amount, duplicate payment). There are, however, some differences. For example, unlike its predecessors, the PIIA establishes a monetary threshold for “significance” determinations, requires agencies to post improper payment reports on their respective websites, tasks OMB with developing PIIA guidance for agencies, and requires OMB to create a centralized website for agencies’ improper payment reports concerning OMB-designated “high-priority” programs.

Because OMB has not yet issued implementing guidance under the PIIA, the contours of agencies' reporting and/or assurance obligations remains unknown.  Nonetheless, the Access Board can definitively state that, based on the PIIA's statutory definition of "significance," the agency had no programs/activities at significant risk of improper payments in FY 2023.

#### Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA)

The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA), as amended, maximizes collection of delinquent debts owed to the federal government by facilitating timely action to collect outstanding debts and minimizing collection costs through use of centralized and/or cross-agency collection mechanisms for most non-tax debts.  Under the DCIA, federal agencies are required to refer non-tax debts that have been delinquent for more than 120 days to the Treasury Department for collection.

The Access Board pursues the collection of delinquent debt.  When it does have DCIA-covered accounts that have been past due for more than 120 days, these debts are referred to the U.S. Treasury for collection.

#### Prompt Payment Act of 1982

The Prompt Payment Act requires federal agencies to make timely payments to vendors for covered supplies and services, pay an interest penalty when payment is made after the due date, and take cash discounts when economically justified.  The Access Board always strives to maintain a 100% on-time payment rate and, in FY 2023, incurred $0 in interest penalties.  The agency will work to maintain 100% on-time vendor payments in future fiscal years.

#### Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act)

The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (the DATA Act) requires agencies to establish common standards for financial data provided by all government agencies and to expand the amount of data that agencies must provide to the government website [USAspending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/), the official open data source of federal spending information.

BFS/ARC has implemented software that enables the Access Board to comply with DATA Act requirements. In FY 2023, the agency was compliant with applicable DATA Act requirements and timely submitted all certifications.

#### Anti-Deficiency Act

The Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits federal employees from obligating more funds than are available under an appropriation, or before appropriated funds are available, or from volunteering their services to the federal government.  The Access Board had no anti-deficiency violations in FY 2023.  As required by this Act, the agency would notify appropriate authorities were such a violation to occur.

#### Computer Information and Security Program

The Federal Information Security Act of 2002 (FISMA), as amended by the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014, requires agencies to ensure adequate security protections for federal information systems and information.  The Access Board continues to make improvements to internal controls through policy, procedure provisions, and an emphasis on employee development. As part of this effort, the Access Board achieved its Authority to Operate (ATO) in FY 2020.  The agency employs ongoing maintenance and testing to keep its ATO active, and further implementation measures will be required to meet the new revision 5, which includes additional provisions for privacy.

#### Performance Data Verification

The Access Board requires accurate performance data to assess the agency's progress toward its strategic goals and make good management and program decisions.  The performance data reflected in Part Two of this report were compiled throughout the fiscal year during the normal course of agency business.  Although the information herein has not been subject to a formal validation process, it has been reviewed for accuracy by agency leadership.

### Limitations on Financial Statements

The principal financial statements have been prepared to report the financial position and results of the operations of the Access Board, pursuant to the requirements of 31 U.S.C. § 3515(b).  The statements have been prepared from the books and records of the Access Board in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for federal entities and the formats prescribed by OMB. Reports used to monitor and control budgetary resources are prepared from the same books and records.  The financial statements should be read with the realization that they are for a component of the U.S. government, a sovereign entity.
