## Goal #1: Establish Technical Specifications for Accessible Design

The Access Board's first strategic goal is supported by five objectives, which are:

- Objective 1.1: Develop and update technical specifications to achieve accessibility.
- Objective 1.2: Coordinate with standards and codes organizations to build effective industry accessibility standards.
- Objective 1.3: Engage with the public, including underserved communities, to inform the development of accessible design.
- Objective 1.4: Address accessibility of emerging technologies and design trends.
- Objective 1.5: Collaborate with organizations to encourage research on accessibility.

### Background

In its mission and under its statutory authority, the Access Board develops and maintains accessibility standards and guidelines, and Goal #1 establishes objectives that direct Board staff and operations to complete such work. The Access Board is responsible for developing and maintaining accessibility criteria for the built environment, transportation vehicles, ICT, medical diagnostic equipment, and outdoor recreational areas under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA), and Sections 508 and 510 of the Rehabilitation Act. In general, the Access Board has regulatory authority for two different types of accessibility criteria: (1) accessibility “guidelines,” which only have force of law when formally adopted through regulation by an enforcing entity --- typically, another federal agency; and (2) accessibility “standards,”1 which have force of law upon issuance. For example, under the ADA, the Departments of Justice and Transportation must provide for at least the level of accessibility in the Access Board’s guidelines when implementing regulations addressing the accessibility of state and local government facilities, places of public accommodation, and transportation vehicles, respectively.

By contrast, under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Access Board is charged with issuing technical and functional performance standards for the accessibility of ICT that federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use, and these standards are enforceable upon promulgation by the Access Board. Technical standards for medical diagnostic equipment issued under Section 510 of the Rehabilitation Act[^1], part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, are voluntary in nature. Federal agencies are not required to adopt these standards, but they may adopt them as mandatory requirements under the ADA or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation (applicable to facilities that receive federal financial assistance).

[^1]: Section 510 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. 794f, directs the Access Board to issue “standards” for the accessibility of medical diagnostic equipment, but neither requires agencies to adopt such standards, nor makes the standards enforceable once issued.

### Summary of Key Accomplishments in FY 2025

#### Compliance with Executive Order 14192

On January 31, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 14192, entitled “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation.” Among other things, the Order requires that agencies identify ten regulations for repeal for each regulation they propose for notice and comment or finalize during FY 2025. Also, the incremental cost of any regulations finalized during FY 2025, including repealed regulations, must be significantly less than zero. In furtherance of the goals of EO 14192, the Access Board has placed on inactive status four regulatory actions – on accessibility of electric vehicle charging stations, self-service transaction machines, rail vehicles, and passenger vessels. Previously, final guidelines on accessibility of electric vehicle charging stations and proposed guidelines on accessible self-service transaction machines were planned for issuance in FY 2025.

#### Guidelines for the Accessibility of Universal Changing Stations

The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 directs the Access Board to establish comprehensive accessible design standards for universal changing tables and standards on the privacy, accessibility, and sanitation equipment of the room in which such tables are located, required to be installed, or maintained. See 49 U.S.C. § 47107(y). These standards will be used by sponsors of medium and large hub airports that are seeking airport development project grants.

In FY 2025, Access Board staff drafted an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to seek information from the public regarding the approach to the future rulemaking. The Board must vote to send the ANPRM to OMB for review. A Board vote on the ANPRM is anticipated during the first quarter of FY 2026.

#### Participation in Development of Voluntary Consensus Standards

Objective 1.2 reflects the agency’s long-standing history of collaborating with model code groups and standards development organizations (SDOs) on codes and voluntary consensus standards related to accessibility. To contribute to the achievement of Objectives 1.2, 1.4, and 1.5, Board staff also served on numerous committees, technical working groups, and cooperative research panels in FY 2025 to ensure that the agency’s technical expertise and perspectives contribute to the development (or revision) of model codes and standards that affect accessibility in a wide range of settings, including such areas as: the built environment; recreational facilities; websites and web content; public transportation technologies; and traffic control devices. The Access Board believes such efforts enhance its credibility as a knowledgeable source of information regarding technical aspects of accessibility. Moreover, working cooperatively with codes organizations and SDOs’ standards brings greater likelihood of harmonization between private codes/standards and federal accessibility requirements.

In FY 2025, Board staff served on, or worked with, the following model code groups, standard-setting organizations, and research cooperatives:
-   American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) Committee on Sports Equipment, Playing Surfaces, and Facilities
