## Goal #3: Improve the Accessibility of the Federal Government

The Access Board's third strategic goal is supported by three objectives, which are:

- Objective 3.1: Improve the accessibility of federal buildings and facilities through enhanced awareness and robust enforcement of the ABA.
- Objective 3.2: Improve accessibility of federal information and communication technology through collaboration with other federal agencies.
- Objective 3.3: Be a model employer of persons with disabilities.

### Background

Improving the accessibility of the federal government is a foundational pillar of the Access Board’s mission. The agency was established by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to be the sole agency responsible for the enforcement of the Architectural Barriers Act. The ABA requires most buildings designed, constructed, altered, or leased by the federal government --- along with certain other federally-financed facilities --- to be accessible to and usable by people with disabilities. 

The Access Board is charged, under Section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act, with developing and maintaining standards for the accessibility of facilities to which the ABA applies. Four standard-setting agencies --- the United States Postal Service (USPS), GSA., the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) --- adopt these guidelines as applicable to facilities within their jurisdiction. USPS, GSA, and DoD have adopted the Access Board’s 2004 ABA Accessibility Guidelines. HUD has not adopted these guidelines to date, and so the earlier Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) apply to ABA-covered facilities within HUD’s jurisdiction. In late 2024, GSA also adopted the Access Board’s Public Right-of-Way Accessibility Guidelines (PROWAG) as part of its ABA Accessibility Standards (ABAAS)[^2]. The agency’s ABA compliance and enforcement program staff process and investigate complaints under the standards applicable to each of these four agencies. When violations are found, the Access Board works with the appropriate federal agency or facility owner/leaseholder to remedy these barriers. 

Each year, the Access Board receives ABA complaints concerning a wide range of federal buildings and facilities, such as: federal office buildings and United States Courthouses; Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers and Community-Based Outpatient Clinics; Social Security Administration (SSA) offices; post offices; National Parks; and DoD facilities, including buildings where civilians are employed, base exchanges, military family housing, and Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) facilities. 

Enforcement Program staff also work proactively with federal agencies and others to ensure that relevant officials at headquarters, regional and field offices, and local sites have a working knowledge of their accessibility obligations. The Access Board has cultivated partnerships with senior leaders at its sister federal agencies, particularly those that own, manage, or lease federal properties or see frequent ABA complaints. 

While the Access Board continues to successfully execute its ABA-related mandates, its responsibilities have expanded significantly during its 50-year history. One such duty includes ensuring that ICT is accessible to and usable by people with disabilities, as required under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. Federal agencies must develop, procure, maintain, and use ICT that is accessible; this ensures equal access to federal employment for people with disabilities and reduces the need for agencies to undertake individual accommodations. In addition, this ensures that members of the public with disabilities have access to government information and services. The Access Board is undertaking initiatives in partnership with other federal agencies to promote and advance ICT accessibility throughout the federal sector. 

In all its work, the Access Board seeks to remove barriers that people with disabilities experience. Nevertheless, the Access Board acknowledges that these outward, public-facing endeavors cannot succeed if it does not also focus its efforts on its own employees. As such, the Access Board continuously strives to be a model employer of people with disabilities, as required under Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act, in all phases of the employment life cycle—from recruitment and hiring to retention and advancement. 

[^2]: GSA’s ABA Accessibility Standards apply not only to facilities owned by GSA or in which GSA-related activities occur, but to any ABA-covered facility not subject to the standards issued by USPS, DoD, or HUD.

### Summary of Key Accomplishments in FY 2025

#### ABA Enforcement

With respect to Objective 3.1, during FY 2025 the Access Board received 324 new ABA complaints (4.9% decrease in filings from FY 2024) and closed 271 complaints (2.3% increase from FY 2024), which includes 100 complaints where federal agencies (or other facility owner/leaseholder) took corrective action to remediate violations of the applicable accessibility standard --- representing a 17.6% increase over the previous year and more than one-third (36.9%) of all closures.

Presented in Table 1 are ABA caseload statistics for FY 2025, as well as comparative data for FYs 2022 through 2024.   (***Note:*** all tabular data provided in this section about ABA cases was compiled from the Access Board’s cloud-based Complaint Tracking System (CTS), which is the official repository of all ABA complaint files.)

In summary, the **100** ABA complaints closed in FY 2025 based on completed corrective action can be broken down into four broad categories by facility type:

**Defense-related and Veterans Facilities**: The Access Board successfully resolved **9** ABA complaints regarding Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs facilities:
-   Defense Supply Center Columbus (Columbus, Ohio) -- a variety of mandatory corrective actions to enhance or install accessible parking spaces for the North and South parking lots serving Building 20; 
-   Patrick Space Force Base (Brevard Co., Florida) -- installation of three accessible, dispersed ABAAS-compliant sites for recreational vehicles at the Manatee Cove Family Campground; 
-   Naval Station Mayport (Jacksonville, Florida) -- installation of properly dispersed, accessible RV spaces at the Pelican Roost and Osprey Cove RV Parks; 
-   Joint Base San Antonio Lackland (San Antonio, Texas) -- installation of new accessible women's bathroom at Forbes Hall; 
-   Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson (Anchorage, Alaska) -- repair of entrance ramp; 
-   Los Angeles Air Force Base (Los Angeles, CA) -- repair of accessible pool lift at Fort MacArthur Swimming Pool; 
-   Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam (Oahu, Hawaii) -- installation and repair of ramps and accessibility improvements to restrooms; and 
-   Fort Drum (Watertown, New York) -- installation of a compliant patio in an individual accessible residential unit. 

**Post Offices and other USPS facilities**: The Access Board successfully resolved **83** ABA complaints relating to U.S. Postal Service facilities, including: 
-   Installation or repair of accessible doors (adjustment of opening force or installation/repair of automatic door opener) at various locations including post offices in Minnesota, Kansas, Illinois, Arizona, and Texas; 
-   Correction of entrance threshold and repair of broken elevator (Old Chelsea, New York); 
-   Installation of accessible employee parking (Decatur, Illinois); and 
-   Adjustment of door opening force and closing speed, installation of accessible door hardware, re-striping of accessible parking space and provision of accessible signage, installation of accessible service counter, and modification of signage clarifying that service animals are permitted without restriction to those assisting blind or deaf users (Lakeside, Arizona). 

**GSA Facilities**: The Access Board also successfully resolved **4** ABA complaints relating to the following facilities owned or leased by GSA: 
-   William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building (Washington, DC) -- provision of temporary alternative, compliant accessible route enabling members of the public to access the Benjamin Franklin Post Office until Post Office entrance doors are repaired; 
-   U.S. Department of Justice -- Criminal Division (Washington, DC) – reduction of opening force of various interior doors; 
-   San Ysidro Land Port of Entry (San Diego, California) -- installation of directional signs to accessible lanes and kiosks; and 
-   Social Security Administration (Greenfield, Wisconsin) -- modification of curb ramp to compliant slope.

**Other ABA-Covered Facilities**: In addition, corrective action projects were completed at other ABA-covered facilities, including: 
-   Everglades National Park: Shark Valley Visitor Center (Miami, Florida) – the Department of the Interior removed inaccessible picnic tables from the park and benches were placed in accessible locations; 
-   Federal Correctional Institution Texarkana – Command Center (Texarkana, Texas) – the U.S Bureau of Prisons installed an accessible entrance ramp and brought the accessible toilet room into compliance with ABAAS; and 
-   Bitterroot National Forest – Headquarters (Hamilton, Montana) – the U.S. Forest Service has undertaken numerous corrective actions, including correcting the clear floor space adjacent to the activation buttons for the automatic doors, adding sufficient compliant accessible parking spaces for visitors, as well as complaint signage, access aisles, and ground surfaces. 

The balance of ABA cases closed at the end of FY 2025 --- **171** out of 271, or 63.09%—were concluded for a range of technical or legal reasons: **17** because the investigation revealed that the Board lacked jurisdiction (for example, the building was built prior to 1968 and was not altered since, and therefore, was not covered by the ABA); **18** because the investigation revealed that the complaint allegations did not constitute an ABA violation (for example, a building inspection revealed that the element at issue did in fact meet the minimum scoping requirements or technical specifications in the ABA standards); **1** where the standard-setting agency (USPS) issued a waiver; and **127** where the Board made a referral since it determined, without an investigation, that the ABA did not apply to the complainant’s concerns but that another disability civil rights law, such as the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, or the Fair Housing Act, did.

‡ Note: The use of the “administrative closure” designation has varied over time. Prior to FY 2023, the Access Board used the “administrative closure” label for complaints that included unintelligible or “spam” filings and complaints that lacked sufficient details to discern the nature of the allegations. In FY 2023, the Board discontinued the practice of counting spam filings as complaints and ceased to use the “administrative closure” designation. However, during FY 2025, the Access Board resumed the “administrative closure” of cases, using that designation only for complaints stating potential ABA violations, but where was staff was unable to obtain sufficient information from the complainant or other sources to pursue resolution of the complaint. 

#### Raising Awareness of the ABA Compliance and Enforcement Program 

Aside from ABA enforcement, Objective 3.1 also addresses enhancing awareness of the ABA and the Access Board’s enforcement role. For the benefit of other agencies and the public at-large, the Access Board continues to publicize results from its ABA enforcement program on its website and social media accounts. In addition, the Access Board now provides information regarding the ABA and ABA enforcement throughout its training programs. 

In FY 2025, Access Board staff worked to strengthen relationships with federal agencies, increasing the frequency of communications regarding ongoing cases. The Access Board has also established new relationships with additional federal offices. In FY 2025, the Access Board conducted site inspections for atypical cases where critical information could not be obtained through the usual channels. 

#### Government Accountability Office (GAO) 

U.S. Access Board is working with the GAO to provide information for the General Services Administration (GSA) Buildings’ Compliance with Architectural Barriers Act Engagement (108575). GAO is conducting this work in response to a congressional mandate contained in the Water Resources Development Act, Section 2308 which includes a provision for GAO to report on the compliance under the ABA of all office buildings under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of GSA.

#### Accessible Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Federal Agency Collaboration 

With respect to Objective 3.2, Board ICT staff continued leading federal efforts to advance digital accessibility. Congressional activities increased focus on federal agency ICT accessibility and mandated an annual federal agency Section 508 reporting requirement in FY 2023. For each annual report, Board ICT staff partnered with GSA’s Government-wide IT Accessibility Program team and OMB to develop assessment criteria to cover all aspects of Section 508 compliance for federal agencies. In FY 2025, the Board provided accessibility testing of a new agency reporting tool and provided support to agencies with determining and submitting their responses. After the agency response period has closed, the Board will analyze agency responses, identify trends from previous reports, and draft recommendations for the FY 2025 GSA Section 508 Government-wide Assessment report to Congress. 

During the third quarter of FY 2025, the Access Board, GSA and OMB, issued the FY 2025 assessment criteria. The Board provided accessibility testing and remediation guidance to OMB to support the use of an OMB tool for the agency responses to the criteria. Board staff provided technical assistance to agencies completing the self-assessment via open-office hours, recurring meetings, and answered questions via Section 508 listservs, emails, and phone calls. In the first quarter of FY 2025, Board staff also provided subject matter expertise in reviewing and analyzing FY 2024 data and agency responses to assist GSA in interpreting the data for the FY 2024 report. 

The Access Board continued development on the ICT Testing Baseline Portfolio subdomain, a notable expansion of technical assistance materials available for Section 508 and ICT accessibility. To improve the evaluation of ICT for Section 508 conformance across federal agencies, the Access Board develops and maintains ICT Testing Baselines for several types of ICT in partnership with GSA. Each Baseline identifies accessibility properties and provides comprehensive evaluation instructions to ensure accurate test results for each accessibility requirement. The Access Board test processes that incorporate the ICT Testing Baselines produce consistent test results and improve trust in their test reports. Many federal agencies participate and contribute to the Baseline Portfolio, including DHS, OPM, SSA, and HHS. 

In FY 2024, the Access Board released a new Baseline for Electronic Documents and an update to the Baseline for Web. The Baselines are available to federal agencies and industry to improve accessibility testing. In FY 2025, the Board in collaboration with GSA and other federal partners drafted the Baseline for Software and Baseline for Hardware. Work also continues on the development of test cases for the Baseline for Web Alignment Framework which will be used to determine how well test methodologies align to the Baseline for Web. 

Related to the Baseline Portfolio, the Access Board assisted DHS with updates to the Trusted Tester methodology for web content to ensure alignment to the Baseline for Web. Contributions included review of updated test instructions, testing tool updates, training content, and resolution of issues submitted by testers. 

#### Model Employer of People with Disabilities 

The federal government, as the nation’s largest employer, has a special responsibility to lead by example in including people with disabilities in the workforce. The Access Board prides itself on its history of inclusiveness in employment. It is part of who the Access Board is as an agency, and the Access Board will continue this effort as it moves forward to be a model employer of people with disabilities (Objective 3.3). 

In FY 2025, Access Board managers and supervisors received Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) training to ensure they are well-prepared to manage EEO issues effectively. This training included the laws and policies related to EEO, how to manage employee interactions, and how to support the EEO complaint process. The EEO training will assist managers in making informed decisions about discrimination and accommodation requests and will equip them to manage any potential EEO-related issues that arise in the workplace. By training supervisors in EEO, the Access Board creates a more inclusive and respectful work environment, which is essential for maintaining a fair and equitable workplace for all employees. 

The Access Board has conducted the annual self-assessment of Section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 programs against the six essential elements for a model EEO program as prescribed by Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive 715. The agency has analyzed its workforce profiles and conducted barrier analyses aimed at detecting whether any management or personnel policy, procedure, or practice is operating to disadvantage any group based on race, national origin, sex, or disability. 

The Access Board continues to develop an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Awards Program that will recognize Access Board employees and senior leaders for their achievements, contributions, and efforts in supporting equal employment opportunities in the Access Board workplace. The EEO Awards Program is intended to acknowledge and encourage significant and continued efforts in promoting equal employment opportunity into everyday practice to make EEO a fundamental part of the Access Board workplace culture. 

To facilitate the hiring, placement, and advancement of individuals with disabilities, the Access Board conducted a disability self-identification initiative which encouraged all employees to self-identify their disability status. Self-identification of disability status is essential for effective data collection and analysis of the Access Board’s hiring efforts. 

The Access Board continues to maintain a file of “Schedule A” applicants that is reviewed prior to the posting of agency vacancies. Schedule A provides a means for agencies to hire qualified people with disabilities outside of the usual process for hiring into the competitive service. Individuals with disabilities may be hired into “excepted service” positions and then converted to the competitive service after having demonstrated successful job performance over a period of time.
