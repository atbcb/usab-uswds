## Goal #2: Provide Education and Information on the Importance and Implementation of Accessible Design

The Access Board's second strategic goal is supported by four objectives, which are:

- Objective 2.1: Provide training on accessible design.
- Objective 2.2: Provide technical assistance on implementation of accessibility guidelines and standards.
- Objective 2.3: Create educational materials to promote understanding of accessible design.
- Objective 2.4: Use stakeholders' feedback to improve our information services.

### Background

The Access Board provides technical assistance (TA) to the public on its guidelines and standards and with other aspects of accessible design through a TA hotline, published documents, and webinars and training. The agency responds to thousands of TA inquiries each year via phone and e-mail. In recent years, the Access Board’s website has also become a well-utilized resource on accessible design. Users of the website can, among other things, view the Access Board’s accessibility guidelines and standards, as well as animations, which illustrate the rationale behind the guidelines and standards and demonstrate how accessible features are used by individuals with disabilities. All published materials are downloadable in accessible formats. Collectively, the Access Board’s TA services play a critical role in assisting design professionals, governmental jurisdictions, people with disabilities, and other stakeholders understand and apply accessible design requirements.

### Summary of Key FY 2025 Accomplishments

#### Technical Assistance

The Access Board’s TA program is a signature service to the public, enabling the agency to achieve Objectives 2.1 and 2.2. Inquiries are fielded through the Access Board’s TA phone line and via e-mail. TA helps improve understanding of accessibility requirements and their application to specific, real challenges posed by members of the public. In FY 2025, Board staff managed over 4,700 TA inquiries, representing a 17% decrease from FY 2024. The decrease in TA inquiries was expected when compared to FY 2024. Due to Executive Order 14192, no new guidelines were released as NPRMs or adopted in FY 2025, whereas the Public Right-of-Way Accessibility Guidelines (PROWAG) were finalized and adopted as ABA Standards immediately before the beginning of FY 2024, leading to an increase in PROWAG specific inquiries. Additionally, more proactive training opportunities (such as providing ABA training for all GSA regions) reduced the number of incoming TA questions.

Central to the agency’s technical assistance services, Board staff use an internal Knowledge Management System (KMS) to efficiently track and manage inquiries. Inquiries and staff answers are categorized and documented in the KMS. Unique and challenging questions requiring additional consideration and research are marked for review and discussed during weekly staff meetings. This information serves as a learning opportunity for technical staff and to gain consensus. Final answers are then documented in the KMS, with hyperlinked references to relevant agency materials, citations, responses to past TA inquiries, and notations about accessibility or design issues. KMS data is also regularly analyzed to help reveal important technical assistance trends, hot topics, and incorporated into training, educational materials, and in some cases, rulemaking. 

#### TA Guidance

As part of its TA program, the agency develops various educational materials (Objective 2.3) to help explain various aspects of its guidelines under the ADA, ABA, and other laws. The agency’s issuance of guidance documents and other TA documents further illustrate the practical application of relevant existing ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines. Additional documents include recommendations and best practices to improve access to a site, building, facility, space, element, or service. Board staff produce informative animations that help design professionals understand the reason and method for applying the ADA and ABA Accessibility Standards.  The agency’s website provides a complete list of its [Guidance Documents]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidance.html) (including animations and videos) and its [TA documents]({{ site.baseurl }}/tad).

The Access Board provides publicly available guides/technical bulletins that cover Chapters 1-6 and the Signs section of Chapter 7. During FY 2025, staff completed final drafts of Chapter 7 guides covering Communication Elements and Features of the ADA and ABA which includes fire alarm systems, telephones, detectable warnings, and two-way communications systems. 

Board staff have also been developing clarifying images to explain certain technical assistance situations. An internal archive has been created, allowing all technical staff to use the images to better explain requirements that can be difficult to describe verbally. 

#### Other Technical Assistance and Resources

The Access Board achieves Objective 2.3 through other efforts, such as collaborations, resources, and public communication. In FY 2025, Board staff accomplished several interagency collaborations, including in-depth technical assistance to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), GSA, Social Security Administration (SSA), National Park Service (NPS), Architect of the Capitol (AOC), and a partnership with Amtrak to continuously facilitate accessibility improvements as rail cars are updated.

#### Access Board Website

In FY 2025, the Access Board continued refining and updating the agency website as the national resource on ADA and ABA accessible design, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, and other accessibility provisions. Through this site, the Access Board provides updates to federal agencies and members of the public on rulemaking, research, ABA enforcement, training, technical assistance, and other programs. 

The Access Board routinely contributes to technical assistance materials posted to [Section508.gov](https://www.section508.gov/).  Board staff contributed to the assessment criteria for the government-wide Section 508 assessment, accessible social media webpage, best practices for Section 508 complaints, and articles on typography and equations. 

The Access Board also improved the print versions of its web pages by updating the website’s print styles. This is a best practice for accessibility as it removes the labor required to create PDF versions of existing web pages. The agency has presented this approach in collaboration with Accessibility Community of Practice partners.

#### Agency-Sponsored Trainings and Webinars

The Access Board hosts monthly accessibility webinars and provides a wide range of training at local and national conferences for specific audiences throughout the year. In FY 2025, the training plan focused on making changes to the implementation of webinars and trainings to include data gleaned from audience post-webinar survey feedback. While the Access Board webinars consistently receive positive feedback overall, this strategy further incorporated audience suggestions to enhance meeting the needs of all learners and maximizing access to the webinar delivery. An analysis of the audience feedback data was completed and reviewed with the OTIS team. The result of this review has been reflected in the webinar series by, (1) increasing use of real-world examples, case studies and actual technical assistance scenarios received by the Access Board; (2) increasing collaboration with external speakers, and; (3) initiating a change in presentation format for optimal content delivery (e.g., panel presentation, breaking webinar content into two parts, etc.) to maximize audience engagement. The FY 2025 training strategy also included alignment of the webinar content with Access Board priorities. 

In FY 2025, the Access Board presented 10 of the scheduled 12 built environment webinars and 5 of the 6 scheduled 508 best practices webinars. One webinar was cancelled due to the observance of former President Jimmy Carter’s funeral service, and two webinars were cancelled due to policy changes impacting the external Federal agency speaker’s participation. Overall, the number of training and webinars completed (66) decreased by 33% compared to FY 2024 and subsequently, webinar participants (over 14,500) also decreased by 42% this year over FY 2024. The cancelled webinars combined with a pause in government travel at the beginning of the fiscal year influenced the overall training numbers.

#### Facilitated Webinars

TThe Access Board’s monthly webinars for the built and digital environments continue to be a valuable resource for disseminating technical information on accessibility guidelines and standards to a broad range of audiences. Participants are provided with the option to join live or to later view archived recordings posted on the website. Currently, the Access Board hosts a catalog of 164 archived webinars. Additionally, there are 14 self-paced, archived webinars that offer continuing education credits (CEUs).

The built environment bi-monthly webinars ([AccessibilityOnline](https://www.accessibilityonline.org/)) focuses on the ADA and ABA Accessibility Standards and provides technical assistance on a range of facility types and covers common sources of confusion. These monthly, 90-minute sessions are facilitated through a contractor. All webinars include sign language interpreting and real-time captioning. New for FY 2025, the Access Board initiated using a new feature within the webinar delivery platform that allows attendees to have more control of the sign language interpretation such as (1) viewing the interpreters in a separate window with continuous uninterrupted viewing; (2) controlling the size and location of the interpreter window, and; (3) hiding the interpreter window from view by attendees who may find it distracting. CEUs are available to participants upon request. Recent built environment webinar topics include accessibility in historic buildings and facilities, accessible polling places, and ABA accessibility for leased federal facilities.

The Board's second bi-monthly series highlights [Section 508 Best Practices](https://www.accessibilityonline.org/cioc-508). This series provides a pipeline of information and best practices for federal agencies to emulate in meeting the accessible ICT requirements. Recent Section 508 Best Practices webinar topics include a free and accessible media player, accessible options other than PDFs, and an exploration of global accessibility laws.
