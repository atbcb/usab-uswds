## Stewardship Objective: Improve Agency Systems and Modernize Operations

The Access Board's stewardship objective/goal is supported by three objectives, which are:

- Objective 5.1: Use data and technology to enhance operations and services.
- Objective 5.2: Use tools and internal systems to consolidate and retain agency knowledge.
- Objective 5.3: Update agency policies, procedures, and administrative regulations.

### Background

The Modernizing Government Technology Act provides a clear mandate for federal agencies to seek opportunities for improving efficiency, effectiveness, and the quality of service provided to the public. This initiative emphasizes the need for federal organizations to adopt modern, scalable technology solutions that align with the evolving needs of both internal operations and citizen engagement. In this context, the Access Board plays a crucial role by outlining specific requirements for agencies to implement centralized identity management systems that are not only secure but also capable of integrating seamlessly into a variety of applications and commonly used platforms. 

The integration of these systems is vital for ensuring that agencies can securely manage user access while streamlining operations. Moreover, Office of Information Technology resources are foundational to supporting the Access Board's broader strategic objectives, particularly in terms of enhancing the performance and functionality of agency systems. This support is integral to the Access Board's efforts to modernize its infrastructure, making it more resilient, efficient, and adaptive to the needs of the government and the public it serves. 

In line with recent and ongoing IT mandates, the Access Board's overarching goal is to create a unified environment that fosters standardized enterprise platform solutions, consistent processes, and robust governance frameworks. These efforts aim to eliminate redundancies, reduce risks, and increase the agility of federal IT systems. Another key focus is the modernization of legacy equipment, which can hinder operational efficiency and security. By replacing outdated systems and technologies, the Access Board seeks to enhance both the security and performance of its IT infrastructure, ensuring that it remains capable of supporting the evolving needs of government operations in the digital age. 

### Summary of Key Accomplishments in FY 2025

#### IT Modernization

In FY 2025, the Access Board made significant strides toward stabilizing and advancing its IT infrastructure modernization initiatives. This progress was achieved through the successful integration of several new technologies and tools aimed at enhancing the agency’s stewardship objectives. Notable accomplishments included the achievement of Authority to Use (ATU) for the agency’s main website, completion of internal and external vulnerability threat verification and remediation of major findings, and the next phase of the single sign-on (SSO) solution with Okta as part of the agency’s broader Zero Trust strategy for Identity Management. This implementation is a critical component of ongoing efforts to improve security and streamline user access across systems. Additionally, in FY 2025, the Board successfully completed its migration to Palo Alto security devices and identified and implemented an alternative identity management solution to further strengthen its cybersecurity posture. 

The Board’s modernization efforts also extended to mobile devices, including the upgrading of all cell phone devices and transferring security to a singular platform of Microsoft Intune. This step was part of a broader initiative to safeguard all agency devices. As a key element of the FY 2025 modernization efforts, all agency computers were updated to ensure conformation with cybersecurity standards and secure operating systems. Moreover, the agency's devices are now managed through Microsoft O365 systems, which allow for remote control over computers—enabling tasks like imaging, locking, wiping, and updating software and hardware to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The Access Board has made considerable progress in modernizing its mobile device management capabilities; this advancement is crucial to the Board's overall security strategy, as it ensures that mobile devices are secure, up-to-date, and compliant with agency policies. The goal is to protect the network and sensitive data from unauthorized access, further reinforcing the Board’s cybersecurity infrastructure. Key initiatives, including Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), full Personal Identity Verification (PIV) implementation, and the adoption of Zero Trust architecture, are well underway, moving the agency closer to completion. 

In addition to these efforts, the Access Board migrated all its cybersecurity policies to NIST 800-53 Rev 5, aligning with the latest industry standards. The cybersecurity team continues to review the Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M) to effectively track and manage risks, ensuring comprehensive oversight. Another key initiative in FY 2025 is the ongoing work of migration of local data center servers to the Azure Cloud. This shift will result in a significant reduction in costs associated with maintaining physical data centers while enhancing flexibility, scalability, accessibility, security, and deployment speed. 

The transition of Continuous Diagnostic Monitoring (CDM) to the Azure platform has also proven invaluable in strengthening the Access Board’s cybersecurity efforts. CDM has enhanced several key areas, including asset management, risk management, vulnerability management, and tracking of Agency-Wide Adaptive Risk Enumeration (AWARE) scores and FISMA metrics. With these improvements, the Access Board is now better equipped to track Binding Operational Directives and Emergency Directives in real-time, while staying ahead of emerging cybersecurity threats. All these efforts support Objectives 5.1 and 5.2.

#### Updated Policies

To support Objective 5.3, the Access Board made significant progress in FY 2025 by developing many new IT and cybersecurity policies all the while updating many outdated existing ones. During FY 2026, additional policies will be created and implemented to accommodate the various federal mandates and other OIT initiatives. 

In FY 2025, the Access Board finalized the new procedures for providing Personal Assistance Services (PAS), in compliance with 29 C.F.R. §1614.203(d)(5), a regulation that enforces Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 501, as amended by 29 U.S.C. § 791). These procedures are designed to ensure that the Access Board meets its legal obligations while providing necessary assistance to its employees. Also in 2025, the Access Board issued a revised Privacy by Design policy. This updated policy outlines the agency’s requirements for embedding privacy considerations into the planning and execution of ongoing project initiatives. It aims to ensure that privacy is prioritized throughout the lifecycle of projects and technologies developed at the Access Board. In accordance with the Presidential Memorandum “Restoring Accountability for Career Senior Executives,” the Access Board has updated its senior executive service and senior professional performance management policies. This memorandum aims to ensure that the executive management of the government of the United States is responsive to the needs, policies, and goals of the nation and is of the highest quality. Finally, the Access Board has been actively working to enhance its privacy program. This includes collaborating closely with OIT to strengthen protocols for addressing privacy incidents and data breaches. In FY 2025, several key policies and procedures were implemented, including a Breach Response Policy, Training and Awareness Policy, and a Breach Response Procedure. These documents were introduced to provide clear guidance on how to manage privacy breaches and raise awareness within the agency. While these policies are already in place, they are undergoing regular reviews and updates to maintain alignment with evolving best practices and ensure their continued effectiveness.
