#### NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

##### A. Reporting Entity

The Access Board is an independent Federal agency that promotes equality for people with disabilities through leadership in accessible design and the development of accessibility guidelines and standards.

Created in 1973 under section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act to ensure access to federally funded facilities, the Access Board now is a leading source of information on accessible design.  The agency develops and maintains design criteria for the built environment, transit, vehicles, telecommunications equipment, medical diagnostic equipment and information technology. It also provides technical assistance and training on these requirements and on accessible design and continues to enforce accessibility standards that cover federally funded facilities.

The Access Board's reporting entity is comprised of General Funds and General Miscellaneous Receipts. General Funds are accounts used to record financial transactions arising under congressional appropriations or other authorizations to spend general revenues.

General Fund miscellaneous receipts are accounts established for receipts of non-recurring activity, such as fines, penalties, fees and other miscellaneous receipts for services and benefits.

The Access Board has rights and ownership of all assets reported in these financial statements and does not possess any non-entity assets.

##### B. Basis of Presentation

The financial statements have been prepared to report the financial position and results of operations of the Access Board.  The Balance Sheet presents the financial position of the agency. The Statement of Net Cost presents the agency's operating results; the Statement of Changes in Net Position displays the changes in the agency's equity accounts. The Statement of Budgetary Resources presents the sources, status, and uses of the agency's resources and follows the rules for the Budget of the United States Government.

The statements are a requirement of the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 and the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002.  They have been prepared from, and are fully supported by, the books and records of the Access Board in accordance with the hierarchy of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, standards issued by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-136, *Financial Reporting Requirements*, as amended, and the Access Board accounting policies which are summarized in this note.  These statements, with the exception of the Statement of Budgetary Resources, are different from financial management reports, which are also prepared pursuant to OMB directives that are used to monitor and control the Access Board's use of budgetary resources.  The financial statements and associated notes are presented on a comparative basis.  Unless specified otherwise, all amounts are presented in dollars.

##### C. Basis of Accounting

Transactions are recorded on both an accrual accounting basis and a budgetary basis.  Under the accrual method, revenues are recognized when earned, and expenses are recognized when a liability is incurred, without regard to receipt or payment of cash.  Budgetary accounting facilitates compliance with legal requirements on the use of federal funds.

##### D. Fund Balance with Treasury

Fund Balance with Treasury is an asset of a reporting entity and a liability of the General Fund.  It is the aggregate amount of the Access Board's funds with Treasury in expenditure, receipt, revolving, and deposit fund accounts.  Appropriated funds recorded in expenditure accounts are available to pay current liabilities and finance authorized purchases.

The Access Board does not maintain bank accounts of its own, has no disbursing authority, and does not maintain cash held outside of Treasury.  Funds are disbursed for the agency on demand.

##### E. Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable consists of amounts owed to the Access Board by other federal agencies and the general public.  Amounts due from federal agencies are considered fully collectible.  Accounts receivable from the public include reimbursements from employees.  An allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable from the public is established when, based upon a review of outstanding accounts and the failure of all collection efforts, management determines that collection is unlikely to occur considering the debtor's ability to pay.

##### F. Property, Equipment, and Software

Property, equipment and software represent furniture, fixtures, equipment, and information technology hardware and software which are recorded at original acquisition cost and are depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.  Major alterations and renovations are capitalized, while maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.  The Access Board's capitalization threshold is $50,000 for individual purchases and $500,000 for bulk purchases.  Property, equipment, and software acquisitions that do not meet the capitalization criteria are expensed upon receipt.  Applicable standard governmental guidelines regulate the disposal and convertibility of agency property, equipment, and software.  The useful life classifications for capitalized assets are as follows:

| Description            | Useful Life (years) |
| :---                   | :---: |
| Leasehold Improvements | 9 |
| Office Furniture       | 5 |
| Computer Equipment     | 3 |
| Office Equipment       | 5 |
| Software               | 5 |

##### G. Advances and Prepaid Charges

Advance payments are generally prohibited by law.  There are some exceptions, such as reimbursable agreements, subscriptions and payments to contractors and employees.  Payments made in advance of the receipt of goods and services are recorded as advances or prepaid charges at the time of prepayment and recognized as expenses when the related goods and services are received.

##### H. Liabilities

Liabilities represent the amount of funds likely to be paid by the Access Board as a result of transactions or events that have already occurred.

The Access Board reports its liabilities under two categories, Intragovernmental and Other than Intragovernmental.  Intragovernmental liabilities represent funds owed to another government agency.  Liabilities other than intragovernmental represent funds owed to any entity or person that is not a federal agency, including private sector firms and federal employees.  Each of these categories may include liabilities that are covered by budgetary resources and liabilities not covered by budgetary resources.

Liabilities covered by budgetary resources are liabilities funded by a current appropriation or other funding source.  These consist of accounts payable and accrued payroll and benefits.  Accounts payable represent amounts owed to another entity for goods ordered and received and for services rendered except for employees.  Accrued payroll and benefits represent payroll costs earned by employees during the fiscal year which are not paid until the next fiscal year.

Liabilities not covered by budgetary resources are liabilities that are not funded by any current appropriation or other funding source.  These liabilities consist of accrued annual leave, deferred rent, and actuarial FECA.  Deferred rent is the difference at year-end bewtween the sum of monthyly cash disberusements paid to date for rent and the sum of the average monthly rent calculated based on the term of the lease.

##### I. Annual, Sick, and Other Leave

Annual leave is accrued as it is earned, and the accrual is reduced as leave is taken.  The balance in the accrued leave account is adjusted to reflect current pay rates.  Liabilities associated with other types of vested leave, including compensatory, restored leave, and sick leave in certain circumstances, are accrued at year-end, based on latest pay rates and unused hours of leave.  Funding will be obtained from future financing sources to the extent that current or prior year appropriations are not available to fund annual and other types of vested leave earned but not taken.  Nonvested leave is expensed when used.  Any liability for sick leave that is accrued but not taken by a Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS)-covered employee is transferred to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) upon the retirement of that individual.  Credit is given for sick leave balances in the computation of annuities upon the retirement of Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS)-covered employees.

##### J. Accrued and Actuarial Workers' Compensation

The Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) administered by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) addresses all claims brought by the Access Board employees for on-the-job injuries.  The DOL bills each agency annually as its claims are paid, but payment of these bills is deferred for two years to allow for funding through the budget process.  Similarly, employees that the Access Board terminates without cause may receive unemployment compensation benefits under the unemployment insurance program also administered by the DOL, which bills each agency quarterly for paid claims. Future appropriations will be used for the reimbursement to DOL.  The liability consists of (1) the net present value of estimated future payments calculated by the DOL and (2) the unreimbursed cost paid by DOL for compensation to recipients under the FECA.

##### K. Retirement Plans

The Access Board employees participate in either the CSRS or the FERS.  The employees who participate in CSRS are beneficiaries of the agency's matching contribution, equal to seven percent of pay, distributed to their annuity account in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.

Prior to December 31, 1983, all employees were covered under the CSRS program.  From January 1, 1984 through December 31, 1986, employees had the option of remaining under CSRS or joining FERS and Social Security.  Employees hired as of January 1, 1987 are automatically covered by the FERS program.  Both CSRS and FERS employees may participate in the federal Thrift Savings Plan (TSP).  FERS employees receive an automatic agency contribution equal to one percent of pay and the Access Board matches any employee contribution up to an additional four percent of pay.  For FERS participants, the Access Board also contributes the employer's matching share of Social Security.

FERS employees and certain CSRS reinstatement employees are eligible to participate in the Social Security program after retirement.  In these instances, the Access Board remits the employer's share of the required contribution.

The Access Board recognizes the imputed cost of pension and other retirement benefits during the employees' active years of service.  OPM actuaries determine pension cost factors by calculating the value of pension benefits expected to be paid in the future and communicate these factors to the Access Board for current period expense reporting.  OPM also provides information regarding the full cost of health and life insurance benefits.  The Access Board recognized the offsetting revenue as imputed financing sources to the extent these expenses will be paid by OPM.

The Access Board does not report information pertaining to the retirement plans covering its employees. on its financial statements.  Reporting amounts such as plan assets, accumulated plan benefits, and related unfunded liabilities, if any, is the responsibility of the OPM, as the administrator.

##### L. Other Post-Employment Benefits

The Access Board employees eligible to participate in the Federal Employees' Health Benefits Plan (FEHBP) and the Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Program (FEGLIP) may continue to participate in these programs after their retirement.  The OPM has provided the Access Board with certain cost factors that estimate the true cost of providing the post-retirement benefit to current employees.  The Access Board recognizes a current cost for these and Other Retirement Benefits (ORB) at the time the employee's services are rendered.  The ORB expense is financed by OPM and offset by the Access Board through the recognition of an imputed financing source.

##### M. Use of Estimates

The preparation of the accompanying financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

##### N. Reclassification

Certain fiscal year 2021 balances have been reclassified, retitled, or combined with other financial statement line items for consistency with the current year presentation.

##### O. Classified Activities

Accounting standards require all reporting entities to disclose that accounting standards allow certain presentations and disclosures to be modified, if needed, to prevent the disclosure of classified information.
