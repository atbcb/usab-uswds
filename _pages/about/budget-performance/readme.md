Notes about Performance and Accountability Report (PAR) formatting
- 2018 single file mostly markdown file with larger tables in HTML
- 2019 single file entirely in HTML because builds were failing
- 2020 single file in HTML with improved formatting for tables.
- 2021 main file is mostly markdown but lots of HTML as needed; larger HTML data tables use includes because builds were failing
- 2022 several files with main file entirely in markdown and many includes
  + narrative includes in markdown, complex data tables are stand-alone HTML files
  + file names incorporate a number so that directory listing (by filename) shows includes in order used by main file
