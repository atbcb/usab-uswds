This directory contains pages under the About menu and some other files as well.

Use short file names, one word if possible.  If two or more words are used to name the file, use a hyphen between the words.  
- meetings.md for Board Meetings
- venue.md for Conference Space

Abbreviations are encouraged.  The abbreviations do _not_ have to be obvious.  Examples:
- foia-cfor for Chief FOIA Officer Report

The file name should reflect the permalink.
- One one example of this is cj.md (for "congressional justification")
-- because OMB has requested that all agencies use xyz.gov/cj as the URL for those documents.

The file naming conventions are a work in progress.
- p-something is a policy and have their peramlink in the form of:  /about/policy/something.html
- laws-example is a statute and have their permalink in the form of:  /laws/example.html
