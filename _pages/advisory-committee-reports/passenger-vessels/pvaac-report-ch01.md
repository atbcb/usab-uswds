*Standards and sections from the ADAAG Review Report referenced in this report that have not been reviewed or approved by the committee.

Note: This chapter only applies to passenger vessels subject to subchapters K or H, except where sections are referenced by chapter 12 which addresses subchapters C and T vessels.

Note: Several recommendations incorporate engineering standards published by ASME, ANSI, BHMA and other engineering standards setting organizations. The committee did not review these standards, which were included by reference. Therefore, the committee recommends that the competent regulatory drafting authorities and others specifically review all referenced industry standards to determine their suitability in designing equipment for use onboard ships in the marine environment.

Note: The committee recognizes that these recommendations may apply to vessels not built or constructed in U.S. shipyards, and to systems not manufactured in the United States. Therefore, the committee recommends that the final regulations recognize and accept the use of other equivalent standards, such as the International Standards Organization standards and recommendations, International Electro-Technical Commission Engineering standards and recommendations, Japan Engineering Standards, etc.

Measurements: All measurements are determined based on the vessel's static design condition.
