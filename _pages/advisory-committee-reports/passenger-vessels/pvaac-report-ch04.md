### SCOPING

#### 215 Emergency Alarm Systems

**215.1 Emergency Alarms. **Where emergency alarm systems are provided in public use or common use areas, the alarm shall provide a system with both audible and visual signals complying with 702. Staterooms required by 224 to have accessible alarms shall comply with 702.3.6.

*Advisory 215.1 - Unlike audible alarms, visual alarms must be located within the space they serve so that the signal is visible.*

### TECHNICAL

**702 Emergency Alarm Systems**

**702.1 General. **Emergency alarm systems required to be accessible shall have audible alarms complying with 702.2 and visual alarms complying with 702.3.

**702.2 Audible Alarms.** Audible alarms shall produce a sound that exceeds the prevailing equivalent sound level in the room or space by 15 dBA minimum or exceeds any maximum sound level with a duration of 60 seconds by 5 dBA, whichever is louder. Sound levels for alarm signals shall not exceed 110 dBA.

*Advisory - The committee has noted a conflict between ADAAG requirements for audible alarms and SOLAS/USCG audible alarm systems (46 CFR subchapter J Electrical Engineering 113.25-12(c) Alarm Signals). The committee recommends that the appropriate regulatory bodies reconcile this conflict.*

**702.3 Visual Alarms. **Visual alarms shall comply with 702.3.

*Advisory - The committee notes that international requirements are silent in regards to visual alarm signals in passenger spaces. The committee supports the concept of providing visual alarms in passenger spaces. The Coast Guard should evaluate how ADAAG requirements for visual alarms can be adapted for maritime application.*

> **702.3.1 Light Pulse Characteristics.**
>
> > **702.3.1.1 Type. **The lamp shall be a xenon strobe type or equivalent.
> >
> > **702.3.1.2 Color. **The color shall be clear or nominal white.
> >
> > **702.3.1.3 Flash Rate. **The flash rate for an individual appliance shall be 1 Hz minimum and 2 Hz maximum over its rated voltage range.

*Advisory 702.3.1.3 - Flash rates that exceed five flashes per second may be disturbing to persons with a photosensitivity, particularly those with certain forms of epilepsy. Multiple, unsynchronized visual signals within a single space may produce a composite flash rate that could trigger a photoconvulsive response in such persons. Therefore, installations that may produce a composite rate in excess of 5 Hz should be avoided by decreasing the number of fixtures and raising the intensity of lamps they contain, by decreasing the flash rate of multiple lamps, or by synchronizing the flash rates of multiple fixtures.*

> > **702.3.1.4 Pulse Duration.** The maximum pulse duration shall be two-tenths of one second with a maximum duty cycle of 40 percent. The pulse duration is defined as the time interval between initial and final points of 10 percent of maximum signal.
>
> **702.3.2 Dispersion. **Light dispersion of wall installed appliances shall comply with Table 702.3.2.1. Light dispersion of ceiling installed appliances shall comply with Table 702.3.2.2.
