#### Part I

The following sections from the Coast Guard's CFR, subchapters H and K, and SOLAS conflict with sections from the ADAAG Review Advisory Committee report (ADAAG-R).

**Conflict 1 **EGRESS ELEVATORS - ADAAG-R 207.2 requires that in certain situations at least one accessible means of egress shall be an elevator. In subchapter H, CFR 72.10-5(b) does not allow elevators to be used as a required means of escape. This conflict does not appear in subchapter K.

**Coast Guard CFR Section**

Subpart 72.10 Means of Escape

> 72.10-1 Application.
>
> 72.10-5 Two means required.
>
> > (a) There shall be at least two means of escape from all general areas accessible to the passengers or where the crew may be quartered or normally employed. At least one of these two means of escape shall be independent of watertight doors. For stairway continuity and general requirements for stairways see Sec.72.05-20.
> >
> > (b) Elevators shall not be considered as one of the required means of escape.
> >
> > (c) Stairways serving only a space and a balcony to a space shall not be considered as one of the required means of escape.

**SOLAS Section**

II-2-28.1.2 Means of Escape - Above the bulkhead deck there shall be at least two means of escape from each main vertical zone or similarly restricted space or group of spaces at least one of which shall give access to a stairway forming a vertical escape.

II-2-28.4 In no case shall lifts be considered as forming one of the required means of escape.

**ADAAG Review Report Section**

207 Accessible Means of Egress

> 207.1 General. All accessible spaces shall be provided with not less than one accessible means of egress. Where more than one means of egress is required from any accessible space, each accessible portion of the space shall be served by not less than two accessible means of egress. Accessible means of egress shall comply with 409.
>
> > EXCEPTIONS. 1. Areas of refuge are not required in buildings or facilities protected throughout by a supervised automatic sprinkler system.
> >
> > 2\. Areas of refuge are not required in open parking garages.
> >
> > 3\. Accessible means of egress and areas of refuge are not required in alterations to existing buildings.

207.2 Elevators. In buildings where a required accessible floor is four or more stories above or below a level of exit discharge, at least one required accessible means of egress shall be an elevator complying with 409.3.

207.3 Signs. At exit stairways and elevators serving a required accessible space, but not serving as an accessible means of egress, directional signs indicating the location of accessible means of egress shall be provided. Such signs shall comply with 703.4.

**Conflict 2 **COAMING - 46 CFR 116.1160(d) and 171.122(f) set coaming heights at 3 to 6 inches at some exterior doors. ADAAG-R 404.2.5 limits thresholds at doors required to be accessible to 1/2 inches high maximum, and 303.4 requires changes in level greater than 1/2 to be ramped.

**Coast Guard CFR Sections**

116.1160 Watertight integrity.

> (d) A weathertight door must be provided for each opening located in a deck house or companionway. Permanent watertight coamings must be provided as follows:
>
> > (1) On a vessel on an exposed or partially protected route, a watertight coaming with a height of at least 150 millimeters (6 inches) must be provided under each weathertight door in a cockpit or a well, or on the main deck of a flush deck vessel.
> >
> > (2) On a vessel on a protected route, a watertight coaming with a height of at least 75 millimeters (3 inches) must be provided under each weathertight door in a cockpit or a well.
> >
> > (3) The height of the watertight coaming for a hinged watertight door, need only be sufficient to accommodate the door.

171.122 Watertight integrity above the margin line in a vessel of 100 gross tons or more.

> (f) Each opening in an exposed weather deck must--
>
> > (1) Have a coaming that complies with the height requirements in table 171.124(d); and
> >
> > (2) Have a means for closing it weathertight.

**Table 171.124(d)**

#### Part II

During the review of subchapters H and K of the Coast Guard's CFR and SOLAS, the following sections from the ADAAG Review Advisory Committee report (ADAAG-R) have been identified as being problematic. For example, in some situations, compliance with CFR or SOLAS minimum standards may result in non-compliance with ADAAG-R. The applicable sections have been noted below. In some cases, notes have been provided indicating some of the requirements. Page numbers from the ADAAG-R have also been provided.

1) CFR for Subchapter H and K requires instructions, markings, and alarms (in some cases) for controls of typically crew operated fire fighting systems. Such controls may be located in spaces open to passengers. Mounting heights and operating requirements, signage requirements, and visual and audible alarm requirements of ADAAG-R may be problematic if applied.

**46 CFR**

-   505.4 Mounting height for handrails (34" - 38" above nosing)
-   304 Wheelchair Turning Space (60" circle or "T" shaped space)(p19)

3) For wheelchair seating in assembly areas, ADAAG-R will require wider aisle width than the Subchapter K CFR requires for aisle widths when passenger seating is available. Size depends on length of aisle. When seats are in rows, distance from seat front to seat front must not be less than 30".

**CFR**

-   116.820 Seating in passenger accommodations (aisle < 15' - min width 24", aisle > 15' - min width 30")

**ADAAG-R**

-   221 Wheelchair Spaces in Assembly Seating - Scoping (p13)

-   802.7 Companion Seating (one companion seat per wheelchair space) (P59)
-   206 Accessible Route - Scoping (p7)
-   402 Accessible Route (p23)
-   403.5 Clear Width (36" min.) (p23)

4) ADAAG-R requirements for Accessible Route, Parking Spaces and Passenger Loading Zones should be considered when Subchapter K CFR requirement states that the Master shall ensure that vehicles are distributed for stability.

**CFR**

-   122.340 (d) Vessels carrying vehicles

**ADAAG-R**

-   206 Accessible Route - Scoping (p7)
-   402 Accessible Route (p23)
-   208 Parking Spaces - Scoping (p9)
-   502 Parking Spaces (p35)
-   209 Passenger Loading Zones - Scoping (p10)
-   503 Passenger Loading Zones (p35)

5) For Passenger/overnight accommodations for Subchapter K, ADAAG-R requirements for lodging, clear floor or ground space, and maneuvering clearance must be addressed.

**CFR**

-   116.810(c) - Passenger/overnight accommodations (aisle between berths must be 24" min.)

6) For Subchapter K vessels, a ladder leading to a deck scuttle may not be used as a means of escape except when a vessel is less than 65' in length. For vessels less than 65' in length, a vertical ladder and deck scuttle or window may be used as one of the means of escape from a passenger accommodation space providing that each ladder is mounted at least 7" from the nearest permanent object in back of the ladder. ADAAG requirements for Accessible Means of Egress (Sec 409) must be addressed for this size vessel.

**CFR**

-   116.500(k) and (l) Space accessible to passengers or used by crew on a regular basis must have two means of escape except when vessel is less than 65' in length.

**ADAAG-R**

-   409 Accessible Means of Egress (p33)

#### Part III

During the review of the Coast Guard's CFR subchapters H and K, and SOLAS, the following comments were made by subcommittee members.

1) ADAAG-R has specific requirements for handrails and edge protections on stairs and ramps. CFR for subchapters H and K also require guard rails, deck rails and storm rails in certain situations. ADAAG's underlying safety and accessibility issues should be considered when complying with CFR requirements for guard rails, deck rails and storm rails.
