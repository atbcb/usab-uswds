*Standards and sections from the ADAAG Review Report referenced in this report that have not been reviewed or approved by the committee.

Note: This chapter only applies to passenger vessels subject to subchapters K or H, except where sections are referenced by chapter 12 which addresses subchapters C and T vessels.

Note: Although the report focuses on alterations to existing passenger vessels, some applicable vessel new construction provisions have been included to help the reader understand the context of particular alteration provisions.

#### 106 Definitions

**Admeasure. **The process by which an authority determines the regulatory tonnage of a vessel.

**Alteration. **A change to a passenger vessel that affects or could affect the usability of the passenger vessel or part thereof. Alterations include, but are not limited to, remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, historic restoration, changes or rearrangement of the structural parts or elements, and changes or rearrangement in the plan configuration of bulkheads and partitions. Normal maintenance, repair or redecoration (such as painting or wall papering), or changes to propulsion, mechanical and electrical systems are not alterations unless they affect the usability of the passenger vessel.

**Structural Members. **The components of the vessel that give it its inherent strength, integrity, and resistance to damage. Examples include, but are not limited to, the keel, keelson, stem and stern posts, frames, longitudinals, structural decks, structural and fire protection bulkheads, gussets, floors, stanchions, columns, girders, beams, knees, trusses and hull plating and planking.

Comment: This definition focuses on terms with well-defined meanings in the ship design and building industry.

**Technically Infeasible.** With respect to an alteration of a passenger vessel, something that has little likelihood of being accomplished because existing structural conditions would require removing or altering a structural member; or because other existing physical or vessel constraints prohibit modification or addition of elements, spaces, or features which are in full and strict compliance with the minimum requirements for new construction and which are necessary to provide accessibility.

### SCOPING

#### 201 Application

**201.1 Scope. **All areas of newly designed or newly constructed passenger vessels and altered portions of existing passenger vessels shall comply with the applicable provisions of this report.

**201.2 **Not Used.

Comment: Section was removed because it was confusing.

**201.3** Not Used.

Comment: Section was removed because temporary structures are not provided on passenger vessels.

#### 202 Application to Existing Passenger Vessels

**202.1 General. **Additions and alterations to existing passenger vessels, including qualified historic passenger vessels, shall comply with the applicable provisions of this report except as modified by 202.

**202.2 Additions. **Each addition to an existing passenger vessel shall comply with the requirements for new construction. Each addition that affects or could affect the usability of an area containing a primary function shall comply with 202.4.

**202.3 Alterations.** Where existing elements or spaces are altered, each altered element or space shall comply with the applicable provisions of this report.

> **EXCEPTION1.** Altered elements or spaces are not required to be located on an accessible route, unless required by 202.4.
>
> **EXCEPTION2.** In alterations, where compliance with applicable provisions is technically infeasible, the alteration shall provide accessibility to the maximum extent feasible. Any elements or spaces of the passenger vessel that are being altered and can be made accessible shall be made accessible within the scope of the alteration.
>
> **EXCEPTION3.** In alterations, where compliance with applicable provisions, as determined by the U.S. Coast Guard, would result in:
>
> > a. a readmeasured tonnage that changes the regulatory classification;
> >
> > b. changes in the stability of the vessel not meeting the applicable regulatory standards;
> >
> > c. modifications that reduce the integrity (e.g., strength, and fire resistance) of a Class A or B bulkhead or deck; or
> >
> > d. an increase in power load in excess of the existing power supply,
>
> the alterations shall provide accessibility to the maximum extent feasible. Any elements or spaces of the passenger vessel that are being altered and can be made accessible shall be made accessible within the scope of the alteration.
>
> **202.3.1 Prohibited Reduction in Access. **An alteration that decreases or has the effect of decreasing the accessibility of a passenger vessel below the requirements for new construction at the time of alteration is prohibited.
>
> **202.3.2 Extent of Application.** An alteration of an existing element, space, or area of a passenger vessel shall not impose a requirement for greater accessibility than that which would be required for new construction.

**202.4 Alterations Affecting Primary Function Areas.** In addition to the requirements of 202.3, an alteration that affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function shall be made so as to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered area and the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area, are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, unless such alterations are disproportionate to the overall alterations in terms of cost and scope as determined under criteria established by the Attorney General.

> **EXCEPTION 1.** This requirement does not apply where the alteration work is limited solely to the electrical, mechanical, or plumbing system, or to hazardous material abatement, or automatic sprinkler retrofitting, and does not involve the alteration of any elements or spaces required to be accessible under the applicable provisions of this report.
>
> **EXCEPTION2.** Any elements or spaces required by this provision to be altered shall be made accessible, in accordance with this provision, unless technically infeasible. The alterations shall provide accessibility to the maximum extent feasible.
>
> **EXCEPTION3.** This requirement does not apply where the alteration would result in:
>
> > a. a readmeasured tonnage that changes the regulatory classification;
> >
> > b. changes in the stability of the vessel not meeting the applicable regulatory standards;
> >
> > c. modifications that reduce the integrity (e.g., strength, and fire resistance) of a Class A or B bulkhead or deck; or
> >
> > d. an increase in power load in excess of the existing power supply,
>
> as determined by the U.S. Coast Guard. The alterations shall provide accessibility to the maximum extent feasible.

*Advisory - Where section 202.4 applies, accessibility improvements required by this provision shall be made up to the point that something is technically infeasible as stated by exception 2 or at least one of the four constraints listed in exception 3 is triggered. For example, an alteration is made to a primary function area. This alteration is large enough (using DOJ criteria found in 28 CFR 36.403) to trigger accessibility improvements to the path of travel and to the toilet rooms which serve the altered primary function area. However, if exception 3 limits the improvements required on the path of travel, only that portion of the path unaffected by exception 3 and the toilet rooms would have to be made accessible. Because the entire path of travel was not made accessible, it is probable that funds are available to make accessibility improvements on other items listed in DOJ's priority list, until the available funds are used up. It should be noted that although DOJ's current criteria were used in this example, neither DOJ nor DOT have not made any decision on what criteria shall apply to passenger vessels.*

**202.5 Major Conversions. **Coast Guard classified major conversions only require accessibility improvements to the degree required by the alteration provisions of this report.

*Advisory - The Coast Guard should reevaluate its method of admeasuring vessels, particularly with regard to tonnage openings, when a passenger vessel is trying to provide access for passengers with disabilities. Specifically, the committee is concerned that improved accessibility may be denied due to a change in applicability of subchapters T, K, or H based on increase in tonnage solely due to the loss of a tonnage opening.*

Comment: This is to ensure that the Coast Guard definition of major conversion does not trigger more onerous accessibility requirements than those that this committee recommends.

**202.6 Alterations to Qualified Historic Passenger Vessels. **Alterations to a qualified historic passenger vessel shall comply with 202.3 and 202.4.

> **EXCEPTION 1.** Where the State Historic Preservation Officer or Advisory Council on Historic Preservation determines that compliance with the requirements for accessible routes, or toilet facilities would threaten or destroy the historic significance of the passenger vessel, the exceptions for alterations to qualified historic passenger vessels for that element shall be permitted to apply.
>
> **EXCEPTION2.** Where the State Historic Preservation Officer or Advisory Council on Historic Preservation determines that compliance with applicable provisions would threaten or destroy the historic significance of the passenger vessel, the alterations shall provide accessibility to the maximum extent feasible.

#### 206 Onboard Accessible Routes

**206.2.3 Multi-Level Passenger Vessels.** At least one accessible route shall connect each level required to be accessible, including mezzanines, onboard multi-deck passenger vessels.

> **EXCEPTION 1.** An accessible route is not required to levels located above or below the accessible level in passenger vessels that are less than three decks or that have less than 3,000 square feet (280 m2) per deck.

Note 1: The DOT may revisit the application of the elevator exception to the vessels based on comments received in response to future rulemaking.

Note 2: The elevator exception does not apply to State and local governments. (See 28 CFR 35.151(c))

Note 3: This is the minimum baseline. The DOJ, DOT, or the Access Board (or PVAAC) may expand the exception or develop additional exceptions.

> **EXCEPTION 2.** An accessible route is not required between decks on a high speed ferry with only two passenger decks where all types of passenger facilities are available on the accessible deck.
>
> **EXCEPTION3.** An accessible route is not required to a deck which is less than 300 square feet (28 m2) in size.
>
> **EXCEPTION4.** In alterations to qualified historic passenger vessels where alternative requirements are permitted by 202.6, an accessible route from an accessible entry and departure point to all publicly used spaces on at least the level of the accessible entry and departure point shall be provided.
>
> **206.2.3.1 Stairs and Escalators in Existing Passenger Vessels.** In alterations and additions, where an escalator or stair is provided where none existed previously and major structural modifications are necessary for such installation, an accessible route shall be provided between the levels served by the escalator or stair, unless exempted by 206.2.3.

Example: An existing three deck passenger vessel (which has at least one deck greater than 3,000 square feet) does not have a means of vertical access between all three decks. If a set of new stairs was installed between the first and second deck, and major structural modifications were necessary for the stair installation, then a means of vertical access must be provided between the two decks. If the installation of the new stairs did not require major structural modifications or if the vessel was exempted by 206.2.3 from requiring vertical access, this section would not apply.

****

> **206.2.5 Dining Areas. **An accessible route shall be provided to all dining areas, including raised or sunken dining areas, and outdoor seating areas.
>
> > **EXCEPTION 1.** In passenger vessels without elevators, an accessible route to a mezzanine dining area is not required, provided that the mezzanine contains less than 25 percent of the total area for seating and dining and the same services are provided in the accessible area.
> >
> > **EXCEPTION2.** In alterations, accessibility to raised or sunken dining areas, or to all parts of outdoor seating areas is not required provided that the same services and decor are provided in an accessible space usable by the general public and not restricted to use by people with disabilities.

****

**206.6 Elevators. **New passenger elevators shall comply with 407.2 or 407.3. Where multiple elevators are provided, each passenger elevator shall comply with 407.2 or 407.3.

> **EXCEPTION 1.** Where an elevator is provided in a passenger vessel eligible for the exceptions to 206.2.3, the elevator shall comply with 407.2, 407.3 or 407.4.
>
> **EXCEPTION2.** Where each deck of a ferry is less than 3,000 square feet (280 m2), elevators are permitted to comply with 407.4.
>
> **EXCEPTION3.** Where a passenger vessel is less than 5,000 ITC, elevators are permitted to comply with 407.4.
>
> **EXCEPTION4.** Where a passenger vessel is less than 10,000 ITC and multiple elevators are provided, only one elevator is required to comply with 407.2 or 407.3 and all other elevators are permitted to comply with 407.4.
>
> **206.6.1 Existing Elevators.** Altered elements of existing elevators shall comply with 407.5. Such elements shall also be altered in all elevators that are programmed to respond to the same hall call control as the altered elevator and shall comply with the requirements of 407.5.

Example: A passenger vessel has four existing elevators located in a bank. If the car controls in one elevator were altered, under this section, the elevator car controls in the three other elevators must be altered. However, if an alteration is performed on one elevator, alterations would not be required to any other elevator where at least one of the exceptions in 202.3 applies.

**206.7 Wheelchair (Platform) Lifts. **Wheelchair (platform) lifts shall be permitted as a component of an accessible route in new construction as permitted by 206.7.1 through 206.7.4, and shall comply with 408. Wheelchair (platform) lifts provided as a component of an accessible route in an existing passenger vessel shall comply with 408.
