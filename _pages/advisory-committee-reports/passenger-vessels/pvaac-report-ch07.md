### SCOPING

#### 224 Passenger Staterooms

**224.1 General. **Passenger vessels shall provide passenger staterooms in accordance with 224.

> **224.1.1 Alterations.** Where staterooms are altered or added, the requirements of 224 shall apply only to the staterooms being altered or added.
>
> > **EXCEPTION: **The requirement for making altered staterooms accessible may be met by altering staterooms in other locations in the vessel if equivalent or greater access is provided. Staterooms that are substituted in lieu of the altered staterooms must comply with dispersion requirements of 224.5.
>
> **224.1.2 Staterooms Doors and Doorways. **Entrance and passage doors and doorways into and within all staterooms shall provide clear width complying with 404.2.3.
>
> > **EXCEPTION:** On each deck, staterooms narrower than the width of the smallest accessible stateroom are not required to comply with this section, where:\
> > (1) at least one accessible hospitality room is provided per 100 staterooms on the vessel or at least one accessible hospitality room is provided on each stateroom deck with stateroom doors not complying with 404.2.3; and\
> > (2) all passenger staterooms in the vessel required to comply with 805.2 (wheelchair accessible room) have at least one door complying with 404.2.3 which provides access directly into an adjacent passenger stateroom which is not required to comply with 805.2. Each accessible hospitality room, provided under this exception, shall comply with 805.4 and must have a size equal to or greater than the size of an average passenger stateroom in the vessel and must contain an accessible toilet room equipped with at least a water closet and lavatory, if other staterooms on the deck have toilet rooms. Stateroom width is the largest interior dimension of a stateroom measured parallel to the corridor from which the stateroom is entered.

*Advisory 224.1.2 - Doors not requiring full user passage, such as shallow closets, are not covered by this provision. However, shower doors would be covered.*

**224.2 Accessible Staterooms.** In passenger vessels, accessible staterooms shall be provided in accordance with Table 224.2 and shall comply with 805.2.

> **EXCEPTION: **This section does not apply where at least five percent of the passenger staterooms comply with 805.2 and at least 33 percent of these accessible staterooms are provided with roll-in showers.

Comment: Because the table produces in some cases a percentage higher than 5 percent, a 5 percent cap was established by adding the exception. For example, under the table, a vessel with 101 staterooms would be required to have 7 accessible staterooms which equals 6.9 percent. However, under the exception, the above vessel would need 6 (5.05 rounded up) accessible staterooms. This exception only impacts results in the 4rd through 6th row of the table.

Staterooms required to comply with 805.2 and staterooms required to comply with 805.3 shall be dispersed among the various categories of staterooms and shall provide choices of categories of staterooms, types of beds, and other amenities comparable to the choices provided to other passengers. Where the minimum number of staterooms or beds required to be accessible is not sufficient to allow for complete dispersion, rooms or beds shall be dispersed in the following priority: stateroom category, bed type, and amenities.

*Advisory 224.5 - Factors to be considered in providing an equivalent range of options may include, but are not limited to, stateroom size, bed size, cost, view, bathroom fixtures such as hot tubs and spas, smoking and nonsmoking, the number of beds, and the number of staterooms provided.*
