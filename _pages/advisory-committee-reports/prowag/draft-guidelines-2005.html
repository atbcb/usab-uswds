</div><h3>Notice of Availability of Revised Draft Guidelines</h3>
<p>Published in the <em>Federal Register</em> on November 23, 2005.</p>
<p><strong>AGENCY:</strong> Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board.</p>
<p><strong>ACTION:</strong> Notice of availability of draft guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) has placed in the docket and on its web site for public review draft guidelines which address accessibility in the public right-of-way. The draft guidelines are under consideration by the Board. The purpose of placing the draft guidelines in the docket is to facilitate gathering of additional information for the regulatory assessment and the preparation of technical assistance materials to accompany a future rule. The Board is not seeking comments on the draft guidelines. The Board will issue a notice of proposed rulemaking at a future date and will solicit comments at that time, prior to issuing a final rule.</p>

<p><strong>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</strong> In 1999, the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) established the Public Rights-of-Way Access Advisory Committee (Committee) to make recommendations on accessibility guidelines for newly constructed and altered public rights-of-way covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968. The Committee was comprised of representatives from disability organizations, public works departments, transportation and traffic engineering groups, design professionals and civil engineers, pedestrian and bicycle organizations, Federal agencies, and standard-setting bodies. The Committee met on five occasions between December 1999 and January 2001. On January 10, 2001, the Committee presented its recommendations on accessible public rights-of-way in a report entitled "Building a True Community." The Committee’s report provided recommendations on access to sidewalks, street crossings, and other related pedestrian facilities and addressed various issues and design constraints specific to public rights of way. The report is available on the Access Board’s website at <a href="/commrept/index.htm">www.access-board.gov/prowac/commrept/index.htm</a> or can be ordered by calling the Access Board at (202) 272-0080. Persons using a TTY should call (202) 272-0082. The report is available in alternate formats upon request. Persons who want a copy in an alternate format should specify the type of format (cassette tape, braille, large print, or ASCII disk).</p>
<p>The Access Board convened an ad hoc committee of Board members to review the Committee’s recommendations. After reviewing the report in detail, the Board’s ad hoc committee prepared recommendations for guidelines addressing accessibility in the public right-of-way. On June 17, 2002, the Board made the recommendations of the ad hoc committee available for public comment and review by notice in the <em>Federal Register</em> (67 FR 41206).</p>
<p>Over 1,400 comments were received from the public in response to the publication of the draft. Of this total, almost 900 comments were from persons with disabilities and groups representing them; the great preponderance of comments in this category came from people who indicated that they were blind or had low vision. Respondents from the transportation industry, including design engineers and consultants, submitted slightly over 200 comments. Another 100 were received from State and local government administrative agencies. Comments are posted on the Board's website at <a href="http://www.access-board.gov/prowac/comments/index.htm">http://www.access-board.gov/prowac/comments/index.htm</a>. Further discussion of the comments received is available in the supplementary information accompanying the draft guidelines.</p>
<p>The members of the Board’s ad hoc committee subsequently reviewed and considered the comments received in response to the 2002 <em>Federal Register</em> notice. The draft guidelines made available today on the Board’s website are the result of those deliberations. The Access Board is making the draft guidelines available in order to facilitate the gathering of additional information for a regulatory assessment prior to publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking and to assist in the development of technical assistance materials. The Board is not soliciting comments on the draft guidelines. The Board will solicit comments when a proposed rule is issued in conjunction with the regulatory assessment. The draft guidelines along with supplementary information have been placed in the rulemaking docket (Docket No. 02-1) for public review. The draft guidelines and supplementary information are also available on the Access Board’s website at <a href="http://www.access-board.gov/prowac/draft.htm">http://www.access-board.gov/prowac/draft.htm</a>. You may also obtain a copy of the draft guidelines and supplementary information by contacting the Access Board at (202) 272-0080. Persons using a TTY should call (202) 272-0082. The documents are available in alternate formats upon request.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div itemprop="articleBody">
		<div class="attachmentsContainer">

<div class="attachmentsList" id="attachmentsList_com_content_default_1095"></div>

</div><p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) recognizes and protects the civil rights of people with disabilities and is modeled after earlier landmark laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race and gender. To ensure that buildings and facilities are accessible to and usable by people with disabilities, the ADA establishes accessibility requirements for State and local government facilities, places of public accommodation, and commercial facilities. Under the ADA, the Access Board has developed and continues to maintain design guidelines for accessible buildings and facilities known as the ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG). ADAAG covers a wide variety of facilities and establishes minimum requirements for new construction and alterations.</p>
<p>The Board maintains a similar responsibility for accessibility guidelines under the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA). The ABA requires access to certain facilities designed, built, altered, or leased with Federal funds. Like ADAAG, the Board’s ABA accessibility guidelines apply to new construction and alterations.</p>
<p>The Board’s guidelines become enforceable when they are adopted by the standard setting agency for the ADA and the ABA. The agencies responsible for standards under the ADA are the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Transportation (DOT). The agencies responsible for standards under the ABA are the General Services Administration (GSA), the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the United States Postal Service (USPS).</p>
<p>The Board plans to undertake rulemaking to supplement its ADA and ABA accessibility guidelines, which primarily cover facilities on sites, by adding new provisions specific to public rights-of-way. The Board’s aim is to ensure that access for persons with disabilities is provided wherever a pedestrian way is newly built or altered, and that the same degree of convenience, connection, and safety afforded the public generally is available to pedestrians with disabilities. The guidelines would not require alterations to existing public rights-of-way, but would apply where a pedestrian route or facility is altered as part of a planned project to improve existing public rights-of-way.</p>	</div>

<h2>Background</h2>
<div itemprop="articleBody">
		<div class="attachmentsContainer">

<div class="attachmentsList" id="attachmentsList_com_content_default_739"></div>

</div><p><strong>The Need for Guidelines on Public Rights-of-Way</strong><br>Local jurisdictions, and other entities covered by the ADA or ABA, must ensure that the facilities they build or alter are accessible to people with disabilities. The Board’s ADA and ABA accessibility guidelines specify the minimum level of accessibility in new construction and alteration projects and serve as the basis for enforceable standards maintained by other agencies. Currently, the Board’s guidelines, like the industry standards from which they derive, focus mainly on facilities on sites. While they address certain features common to public sidewalks, such as curb ramps, accessible routes, ground and floor surfaces, and bus stops and shelters, further guidance is necessary to address conditions unique to public rights-of-way. Various constraints posed by space limitations at sidewalks, roadway design practices, slope, and terrain raise valid questions on how and to what extent access can be achieved. Access for blind pedestrians at street crossings and wheelchair access to on-street parking are typical of the issues for which additional guidance is needed. In addition, new trends in roadway design, such as the growing use of traffic roundabouts, pose additional challenges to access, while various technological innovations, particularly those pertaining to pedestrian signaling devices, offer new solutions.</p>
<p>The Board previously proposed guidelines for public rights-of-way under the ADA which were published for public comment in 1992 and 1994. Based on the comments received, the Board determined that it should further coordinate with the transportation industry and State and local governments before continuing its rulemaking. Consequently, the Board undertook an outreach and training program on accessible public rights-of-way. Under this program, the Board developed a series of videos, an accessibility checklist, and a design guide on accessible public rights-of-way. In addition, the Board sponsored research on tactile warnings at street crossings, accessible pedestrian signals, and traffic roundabouts. The Board has made this information widely available to the public. The interest in these materials has underscored the need for criteria for public rights-of-way that are definitive and enforceable so that local jurisdictions and others are clear on their obligations when constructing or altering streets and sidewalks.</p>
<p><strong>Public Rights-of-Way Access Advisory Committee</strong><br>In resuming its rulemaking effort, the Board chartered an advisory committee in 1999 to develop recommendations on guidelines for accessible public rights-of-way. Use of advisory committees has become a standard practice in the Board’s process for developing and updating design requirements. Through such committees, interested groups, including those representing designers, industry, and people with disabilities, play a substantive role in recommending to the Board the content of the guidelines to be developed. These committees provide significant sources of expertise while enhancing the level of consensus among stakeholders in advance of proposing a rule for public comment.</p>
<p>The Public Rights-of-Way Access Advisory Committee was composed of 33 members representing disability organizations, public works departments, transportation and traffic engineering groups, design professionals and civil engineers, government agencies, and standards-setting bodies. The committee coordinated its efforts with leading trade organizations represented on the committee, such as the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, and federal agencies, such as the Federal Highway Administration, to ensure that its recommendations were consistent with generally accepted practice among design professionals. The committee organized several subcommittees focused on key issue areas. The subcommittee structure enabled members to continue work on a tight time schedule between meetings of the full committee and allowed for greater public participation in the process.</p>
<p>The advisory committee met regularly over a year’s time, usually in Washington, D.C. but also in Austin and San Francisco. Its work culminated in the issuance of a report, "Building a True Community," which was submitted to the Board in January 2001. The committee’s report provides criteria for the construction or alteration of public rights-of-way that reflects the broad spectrum of expertise represented by committee members. The report follows a "toolbox" approach to the establishment of guidelines designed to facilitate implementation and to promote an understanding of the needs of all users of public rights-of-ways. The report comprehensively covers the various components of public streets and sidewalks and provides criteria for sidewalks, street fixtures and furnishings, street crossings, vehicular ways, parking, and other components of public rights-of-way. In addition, the report includes advisory notes, figures, and discussion of issues that merit further study or special attention in the Board’s rulemaking.</p>
<p><strong>June 17, 2002 Release of Draft Guidelines</strong><br>An ad hoc group of Board members reviewed the committee’s report in depth and crafted a set of draft guidelines based on the committee’s recommendations. Because the draft guidelines departed from the advisory committee’s report in several areas, the Board made an advance draft of the guidelines available for comment by the public. The notice of availability of the draft guidelines was published in the Federal Register on June 17, 2002. The Board requested information and feedback on the draft guidelines, including usability and cost data. In addition to seeking written comment, the Board held a public hearing in Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>Over 1,400 comments were received from the public in response to the publication of the draft. Of this total, almost 900 comments were tabulated from persons with disabilities and groups representing them; the great preponderance of comments in this category came from people who indicated that they were blind or had low vision. Slightly over 200 comments were submitted by respondents from the transportation industry: design engineers and consultants, State and local government departments of transportation, and the organizations and groups that represent them. Another 100 were received from State and local government administrative agencies.</p>
<p>Almost all of the commenters from the two major blindness organizations, the American Council of the Blind (ACB) and the National Federation of the Blind (NFB), and persons who were not affiliated with either organization addressed only the use of detectable warnings and/or accessible pedestrian signals (APS) and virtually all of them supported the requirement for these features in at least some locations (detectable warnings at islands and medians and at all low-slope sidewalk connections to the street; APS at complex intersections, irregular intersections, intersections with compound turning movements, and intersections with leading pedestrian intervals). Some commenters misunderstood the effect of the scoping provisions for these features, believing that all intersections would have to be retrofitted at tremendous cost. In fact, only future new projects would be subject to these guidelines. With respect to APS in particular, only pedestrian crossings that provide pedestrian signals would be required to include APS. Some commenters, expressing concerns about the noise output of APS, were apparently unfamiliar with the quiet, pedbutton-integrated devices now available in the United States (these devices are installed at the departure curb, near the listening user, rather than overhead).</p>
<p>Ten key issues from comment were identified for detailed analysis: crosswalk width; on-street parking; walking speed and pedestrian signal phase timing; elevators at pedestrian overpasses and underpasses; same-side alternate circulation routes; cross slope in crosswalks; detectable warnings; accessible pedestrian signals; roundabouts and roundabout signalization; and alterations. These issues have been addressed in this second draft. Changes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>referenced Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) for crosswalk width;</li>
<li>reduced scoping in on-street parking to be consistent with parking lots;</li>
<li>set walking speed at 3.5 fps (consistent with new recommendations currently under consideration by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices);</li>
<li>eliminated the provision requiring elevators to provide pedestrian access at overpasses and underpasses (either ramps, lifts, or elevators may be used);</li>
<li>modified scoping and technical provisions for alternate circulation routes to be consistent with current MUTCD requirements and alterations requirements, which would permit opposite side routes if same-side routes are not feasible;</li>
<li>provided relief (up to 5%) for maximum cross slope limits in pedestrian crosswalks at midblock and through-street locations where the roadway slope will necessarily exceed 2%;</li>
<li>clarified the placement of detectable warnings on curb ramps, landings, and blended transitions;</li>
<li>clarified the scoping in new construction and alterations of accessible pedestrian signals (APS);</li>
<li>limited pedestrian signalization at roundabouts and channelized turn lanes to pedestrian crossings (to the splitter) of two lanes of traffic or more; and</li>
<li>clarified the scope of alterations to include only that work included in the limits, boundaries, or scope of a planned project; clarified that there is no obligation in the guidelines to expand the scope or limits of a project to include other or adjacent work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes included the addition of significant advisory material throughout the document. Advisory notes are for informational purposes only.</p>
<p>The Board also considered industry recommendations that the guidelines be re-formatted to use transportation metrics and language and to be better coordinated with industry standards and documents, particularly the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).</p>
<p>This draft is now formatted as a stand-alone document that expresses its dimensioning requirements first in international units, as is done in other industry documents. Its provisions have been harmonized with current MUTCD standards, support, options, and guidance. Industry terms and phrases have been adopted, and industry practices recognized where feasible. <br><br>The Board is placing the revised draft in the docket to facilitate the gathering of cost data necessary for the next step in this rulemaking which is the preparation of a regulatory assessment for government review and approval prior to issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). In order to develop an accurate picture of the potential costs and benefits of this rulemaking, the Board must work closely with the transportation industry representatives who have data on both current cost and industry practices and the knowledge and skills to assess potential effects.</p>
<p>The Board is not seeking comments on this draft. Readers will have an opportunity to provide input when the NPRM is published. Additional figures will be included in the NPRM.</p>
<p><strong>Rulemaking Process</strong><br>The Board reviewed the comments received to the draft guidelines and revised the guidelines in accordance with the comments received. The revisions are briefly discussed below in the section-by-section analysis.</p>
<p>The proposed rule will provide another opportunity for public comment on the guidelines. The Board will then proceed to finalize the guidelines based on public comments received in response to the proposed rule. The Board’s guidelines serve as the basis for enforceable standards maintained by other agencies under the ADA and the ABA. The Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation maintain standards based on the Board’s guidelines that apply to facilities covered by the ADA. Design standards for federally funded facilities covered by the ABA are maintained by the Department of Defense, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the General Services Administration, and the U.S. Postal Service. These enforceable standards must be consistent with the Board’s guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship to ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines</strong><br>Relationship to ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines/Format<br>On July 23, 2004, the Board completed an update of ADAAG, the first comprehensive revision of the document since its publication in 1991. The revised ADAAG features a new format and numbering system and a host of updated scoping and technical provisions. On the same date, the Board updated its ABA Accessibility Guidelines along similar lines so that both of the documents are more consistent. The revised ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines may be found on the Board’s website at www.access-board.gov/ada-aba/index.htm.</p>
<p>The draft guidelines for public rights-of-way published on June 17, 2002 were formatted to supplement the ADA and ABA guidelines and not as a stand-alone document. The guidelines were intended to ultimately comprise a new chapter on public rights-of-way. The current draft guidelines made available in this document are now formatted as a stand-alone document using transportation industry standards, terms, and measures in response to recommendations in industry comments. The document is identified by the prefix R in its provisions and has four chapters:</p>
<p>Chapter R1: Application and Administration covers purpose, effect on existing facilities, equivalent facilitation, conventions, figures, units of measurement, referenced documents, and definitions, harmonized with transportation industry usage.</p>
<p>Chapter R2: Scoping Requirements address what items of new construction and alteration are covered by this document and references technical sections that follow in Chapters R3 and R4. Key scoping provisions in R2 include: R204 Pedestrian Access Route; R205 Alternate Pedestrian Access Route; R206 Pedestrian Crossings; R207 Curb Ramps and Blended Transitions; R208 Accessible Pedestrian Signals; R209 Protruding Objects; R210 Pedestrian Signs; R211 Street Furniture; R212 Bus Stops; R213 Stairways; R214 Handrails; R215 Vertical Access; R216 On-street Parking; R217 Passenger Loading Zones; R218 Call Boxes; R219 Transit Platforms; R220 Escalators; R221 Detectable Warning Surfaces; and R222 Doors, Doorways, and Gates.</p>
<p>Coverage extends to temporary as well as permanent facilities. Chapter R2 also includes special provisions for historic facilities and contains a limited series of general exemptions from accessibility.</p>
<p>Chapter R3: Technical Provisions contains detailed specifications for new construction and alterations scoping in Chapter R2. Construction detailed in Chapter R3 is specific to public sidewalk, street crossing, and roadway projects, and covers the building blocks of pedestrian accessibility: the pedestrian access route (analogous to the accessible route on a site), curb ramps and blended transitions, pedestrian crossings (including those at roundabouts and channelized turn lanes), pedestrian signals, street furniture, and parking.</p>
<p>Chapter R4: Supplementary Technical Provisions include specifications adapted from the ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines (2004) for rights-of-way application, including such features as maneuvering clearances at doorways; drinking fountain, and telephone provisions; reach ranges; operable parts; handrails; and other items of broader application.</p>	</div>

</div><h4>DRAFT GUIDELINES FOR PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY</h4>
<p>Clarifications, modifications, and changes that have been incorporated in this draft in response to public comment from industry, consumers, and State and local government agencies are briefly discussed below.</p>
<p><strong>R1: APPLICATION AND ADMINISTRATION </strong><br> R104.2.1 MUTCD. This draft references the 2003 edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). The Access Board works closely with the MUTCD team at the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to harmonize standards and advisory material and to sponsor needed research. Changes in future MUTCD provisions for accessible pedestrian signals, markings (including detectable warnings), and temporary traffic zones are in process. A joint FHWA/ American Traffic Safety Services Association (ATSSA)/Access Board demonstration project identified desirable characteristics for pedestrian channelizing devices. FHWA research projects on pedestrian usability at roundabouts and contrast in detectable warnings are underway, and the Board has proposed a FY 2006 project on pedestrian demand signals for use at multi-lane roundabout crossings.</p>
<p>R105 Definitions. This draft uses definitions drawn from key industry references where they exist.</p>
<p><strong>R2: SCOPING REQUIREMENTS</strong><br> R201 Application. Text and advisory material has been added to clarify the application of these guidelines to new or altered work (permanent or temporary) put in place within the scope or limits of a planned project in the public right-of-way.</p>
<p>Other requirements, including those for existing facilities, maintenance of accessible features, and effective communication that derive from the ADA title II implementing regulations (28 CFR part 35) or Federal highway-aid funding (49 CFR part 27), are not addressed in these guidelines for new construction and alteration. Advisory notes have been added to clarify this difference.</p>
<p>This draft now includes a reference to the revised ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines (36 CFR part 1191) to cover buildings and facilities newly constructed or altered within the public right-of-way.</p>
<p>R202 Alterations and Additions to Existing Facilities. Text and advisory notes have been added to this draft to clarify the application of new construction guidelines to an alteration project. New work put in place within an existing developed right-of-way must comply with these guidelines to the maximum extent feasible; see Advisory R202.3. Transitional segments that connect undisturbed improvements with new work can facilitate compliance (R202.1.1). Where items are placed within an existing developed streetscape and the circulation route is not altered, items required to be accessible shall be located for optimal usability and access (R202.1.2).</p>
<p>An alteration is a change in a space or element that affects, or could affect, the accessibility or usability of that space or element. In general, when a feature in the public right-of-way is altered, the requirements for new construction in this document must be applied to the maximum extent feasible within the scope or boundary of the project that has been planned. This document does not contain a ‘path of travel’ obligation to expand a given scope of work to include other items or elements that are adjacent to the alteration project nor does it cover an agency’s obligations to achieve program access in its existing facilities that are not being altered.</p>
<p>In response to the comments received, the Board has developed answers to frequently asked questions regarding the application of the alterations requirements. Those questions and the Board’s responses have been included at the end of this discussion.</p>
<p>R204 Pedestrian Access Route (technical provisions at R301). This draft clarifies the requirement for a 1.2-meter-wide (4 ft) accessible route of travel within a pedestrian circulation path, which may be a wider sidewalk, shoulder (if pedestrian use is not prohibited), shared street, or street crossing. A provision requiring periodic passing spaces 1.5 m (5 ft) in width, omitted in the first draft, has been re-instituted. Because of the constraints imposed by right-of-way width, the pedestrian access route (PAR) is relieved of the slope limits that would apply to an accessible route on a site provided it matches the general grade of the adjacent roadway (R301.4). Where the PAR is supported by structure, as in an underpass, overpass, or bridge, this draft requires compliance with ADAAG requirements for ramps.</p>
<p>Technical provisions in the June 2002 draft that would have required a 30-inch separation between changes in level in the PAR have been replaced in this draft with provisions requiring a planar surface (R305.1) and limiting surface discontinuities (R301.5.2). An advisory note discourages the use of heavily textured, rough, or excessively chamfered unit pavings. Research undertaken by the Research and Rehabilitation Training Center (RRTC) at the University of Pittsburgh, under contract to a group of unit masonry associations, measured the vibration effects of various chamfer spacings on wheeled mobility devices and found that chamfers of less than 1.25 mm (.5 in), if flush, were not distinguishable from cast-in-place concrete sidewalks with a broom finish.</p>
<p>A series of related provisions in the June 2002 draft has been reorganized into R301.7 Horizontal Openings, which now includes walkway joints, gratings, flangeway gaps at rail crossings, and sill gaps at elevators and lifts. (Platform and car gaps at transit facilities are addressed at 36 CFR part 1191).</p>
<p>R205 Alternate Pedestrian Access Route. This draft clarifies that the establishment of an alternate pedestrian route is an alteration that must comply to the maximum extent feasible with technical provisions for the pedestrian access route, including curb ramps or blended transitions. MUTCD requirements and advisory material at Part 6D.01 and 6D.02 are referenced and an advisory note added to highlight the safety benefits of same-side alternate routes. Specifications for pedestrian channelizing devices and barricades at 302.4 include a reference to the MUTCD.</p>
<p>R206 Pedestrian Crossings (technical provisions at R305). This draft omits a provision in the June 2002 draft that would have required 2.4 m-wide (8 ft) markings at crosswalks. The MUTCD minimum of 1.8 m (6 ft) has been proposed at 305.2.1 of this draft.</p>
<p>Measurements on which pedestrian signal phase timing are based have been modified in response to industry comment. Calculations now proposed in R305.3 in the current draft would require the distance to be the full street width and the pedestrian walking speed to be 1.1 m/s (3.5 fps).</p>
<p>The June 2002 draft also proposed that the approaches to overpasses and underpasses be provided with elevators where the grade change was 1.5 m (5 ft) or greater. Both industry and persons with disabilities opposed this requirement with persons with disabilities expressing a preference for ramps, even if lengthy, to ensure the availability of a crossing. Elevators in single installations provide no access at all when out of service. Industry expressed concerns about cost and maintenance requirements. The current draft applies ramp provisions at R305.5 (but permits elevators, LULAs, and lifts).</p>
<p>Newly available research and the comments of both industry and consumer representatives confirm the Access Board’s concerns about the usability of pedestrian crossings at roundabouts and channelized turn lanes. However, access to additional data has indicated that well-designed roundabouts and channelized turn lanes with single-lane crossings can provide cues that make non-visual use possible. Accordingly, this draft (R305.6.2) provides that signals (including accessible pedestrian signal features) be required only at multi-lane pedestrian crossings of roundabouts. The Board does not prescribe the signal operation here and has proposed that FHWA conduct research to identify appropriate technologies. Two-head signals that flash amber, then flash red and go to steady red, are in use in Australia and the United Kingdom. US motorists are familiar with pre-emptive signals installed for emergency vehicles. Utah has at least one roundabout that uses standard railway gates across the roadway when light rail cars pass through the roundabout. The Board believes that the occasional use of a properly-designed pedestrian demand signal may actually reduce delay at pedestrian crossings.</p>
<p>R207 Curb Ramps and Blended Transitions (technical provisions at R303). Additional text, advisory, and illustrations have been added to this draft to describe curb ramp types (perpendicular, parallel, and their combination) and to distinguish them from blended transitions, for which a definition has now been provided at R105. Blended transitions are connections between the PAR and the street that have a running slope of 1:20 or less. Level landings, gently sloped transitions, and raised crosswalks fall into this category. Parallel and perpendicular curb ramps have a running slope between 1:20 and 1:12 (steeper slopes are not permitted in new construction).</p>
<p>Non-visual wayfinding cues can be provided by the orientation of curb ramps, particularly if they are in-line with the path of pedestrian travel along a sidewalk. Curb ramps installed at tangent points rather than on the corner radius provide more usable cues and locate the shortest crossing point. The Access Board is collaborating with the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) on a project to standardize sidewalk/ramp/crossing schemes for optimal non-visual cuing based upon a range of corner radii and attached/separated sidewalk configurations. An advisory note (R303.1) in this draft notes the benefits for pedestrians.</p>
<p>Cross slope provisions at midblock curb ramps (R303) have been revised in response to industry comment to permit warping to meet roadway grade. Similar changes have been made to technical provisions at pedestrian crossings (R305.2.2). Crossings of streets without stop control would be permitted a 1:20 maximum cross slope.</p>
<p>Running slope limits at crosswalks (R305.2.3) are maintained at 1:20 maximum in this draft. Many commenters noted that design practices that approach this limit in new construction may have to mill the roadway crown before resurfacing in order to retain usable crossings.</p>
<p>R208 Accessible Pedestrian Signals (technical provisions at R306). APS provisions in this draft differ only slightly from those of the June 2002 draft. Many commenters to the June 2002 draft expressed concerns about the costs of retrofitting intersections with APS, which is not required by these or prior proposals, which guide only new construction and alterations. Where new pedestrian signals are being installed or added, scoping in this document would require that they incorporate audible and vibrotactile features.</p>
<p>Comments from disability organizations and individuals to the June 2002 draft were diverse. Many who believed that retrofitting was required objected to what they understood to be excessive cost. And even those who did not support a general requirement that all future pedestrian signals incorporate audible and vibrotactile formats nevertheless saw the need for them at certain types of intersections including irregular crossings, lengthy crossings, and at complex intersections with multiple vehicle turning phases or leading pedestrian interval phasing. Although many responders noted the utility of non-visual cues, a clear majority of commenters who identified themselves as blind supported universal pedestrian signals.</p>
<p>R209 Protruding Objects (technical provisions at R401). Advisory notes have been added at several places in this document to remind users of the need to consider projections into the pedestrian circulation route when coordinating the placement of improvements, appurtenances, utilities, or street furniture. Comments from disability organizations and individuals identified blocked or compromised pedestrian routes as a major barrier to independent travel. Protruding objects provisions in this draft have been revised only to accommodate the new format and add advisory information.</p>
<p>R210 Pedestrian Signs (technical provisions at R409). An advisory note has been added to clarify requirements for visual legibility in signs that indicate sidewalk closure, pedestrian detour, and tourist route signage covered in MUTCD. Braille street name signage is required only on APS pedbuttons (R306.4.2).</p>
<p>Signage provisions in this draft have been revised only to accommodate the new format and add advisory information.</p>
<p>R211 Street Furniture (technical provisions at R307). Advisory notes have been added at several places in this document to remind users of the need to consider the dimensions and use of pedestrian circulation routes when coordinating the placement of improvements, appurtenances, utilities, or street furniture. Comments from disability organizations and individuals identified blocked or compromised pedestrian routes as a major barrier to independent travel.</p>
<p>Street furniture provisions in this draft have been revised only to accommodate the new format and add advisory information.</p>
<p>R212 Bus Stops (technical provisions at R410.2). An advisory note has been added to clarify the difference between establishing a bus stop by installing signage (signage must comply with R210.2) and constructing a bus stop (boarding/alighting areas, if provided, must comply with R410, bus shelters with R410.2).</p>
<p>Bus stop provisions in this draft have been revised only to accommodate the new format and add advisory information.</p>
<p>R213 Stairways (technical provisions at R407). Stairway provisions in this draft have been revised only to accommodate the new format.</p>
<p>R214 Handrails (technical provisions at R408). Handrail provisions in this draft have been revised only to accommodate the new format and add an advisory note on alterations and protruding objects.</p>
<p>R215 Vertical Access (technical provisions in ADAAG). Vertical access provisions in this draft have been revised only to accommodate the new format and add an advisory note on elevator use in extremes of terrain.</p>
<p>R216 On-Street Parking (scoping at Table R216; technical provisions at R308). Table R216 in this draft has been adapted from the table in ADAAG based upon the overall number of spaces provided within a block (or analog). Commenters strongly objected to scoping based upon the numbers of parking spaces on a block face, which could, in many places, require very high numbers of spaces disproportionate to those required in lots.</p>
<p>Additionally, this draft clarifies when, in new construction or alterations, the presence of a sidewalk or border wider than 4.3 m (14 ft) can accommodate an access aisle that is indented into the curb for protected transfer space, a construction that is similar to that of an on-street loading zone provided at an office, hotel, convention center, arena, or airport (R308.2.1).</p>
<p>Advisory notes have been added at several places in this section to convey additional information about indented, end-of-block, perpendicular or angled spaces, and signage. <br> <br> R218 Call Boxes (technical provisions at R309). Call box provisions in this draft have been revised only to accommodate the new format and add an advisory note at R309.1 about the applicability of accessible call box technology to other types of communications systems, such as on-street security systems.</p>
<p>R219 Transit Platforms (technical provisions at R414). Transit provisions from the ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines (204) have been newly incorporated in this draft.</p>
<p>R220 Escalators. Escalator provisions in this draft have been revised only to accommodate the new format.</p>
<p>R221 Detectable Warning Surfaces (technical provisions at R304). Transportation industry and State and local government agency commenters expressed concern about the durability, maintainability, and contrast of detectable warning materials required at curb ramps and blended transitions in the June 2002 draft. Recent research by several State departments of transportation and by the Transportation Research Board identified several high-performing products suitable for both new construction and alterations. Approximately 20 manufacturers now produce detectable warning products in metal, concrete, tile, pavers, resilient sheets, and membrane types. The FHWA is currently overseeing human factors research intended to test the contrast effectiveness of 13 different detectable warning colors when viewed by people who have low vision.</p>
<p>Comments from disability organizations and individuals were divided in much the same way as consumer comments on accessible pedestrian signals. Many expressed concern about cost but, valued detectable warnings as a way to provide a cue at certain locations such as pedestrian waiting areas at roadway medians, islands, and roundabout splitter islands and at low-slope blended transitions to street crossings. A majority of these commenters favored the June 2002 draft provision requiring detectable warnings at flush transitions between sidewalks and street crossings.</p>
<p>The rows of domes in the detectable warning material (technical provisions at R304.2.2) must be aligned with the path of wheelchair travel, which is required to be perpendicular to the grade break at the toe of the ramp to permit tracking between dome rows. On blended transitions, dome orientation is not significant.</p>
<p>A new advisory note (R304.1.1) covers the use of radial dome patterns.</p>
<p>Detectable warnings provisions in this draft have also been clarified with respect to their permitted setback from the grade break marking the face of a curb. One corner of the detectable warning must be within 205 mm (8 in) of the grade break; no other point on the leading edge of the detectable warning may be more than 1.5 m (5 ft) from the grade break (R304.2.1).</p>
<p>R222 Doors, Doorways, and Gates (technical provisions at R411). These provisions have been added to this draft from the ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines (2004). Because public sidewalks serve the entrances and other facilities of abutters covered by title III of the ADA, coordination of slope, cross slope, and maneuvering space requirements is typically required. In many places, developers provide sidewalk improvements as part of a project. State and local governments must include accessibility compliance in such work.</p>	</div>

<h2>Technical Assistance Q&A for Alterations Projects</h2>
<div itemprop="articleBody">
		<div class="attachmentsContainer">

<div class="attachmentsList" id="attachmentsList_com_content_default_741"></div>

</div><p>Alterations are projects planned for implementation by a jurisdiction. Program access obligations for existing facilities are not a part of the Board’s accessibility guidelines, and the Board’s responses to the following questions do not address program access issues (see title II of the ADA at 28 CFR 35.149 and 35.151). <br> <br> <strong>Curb Ramps</strong> <br> Question: A multi-block length of roadway is being resurfaced. The corners have curb ramps that meet some but not all of the current specifications; for example the cross slope may be too steep or the curb ramps do not have detectable warnings. Must the curb ramps be reconstructed as part of the resurfacing project? <br> Answer: Yes, if it is technically feasible to provide complying features. The work should be done at the same time the resurfacing is being done.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> New curb ramps are being installed at an existing developed corner. New construction standards require the curb ramp to be within the crosswalk, but an existing underground utility vault is located where the ramp should be. Must the utility vault be moved? <br> <em>Answer:</em> The scope of this project will determine the answer. If utilities are being moved for other reasons within the project limits, it may be possible to alter or relocate the vault. If project construction will not involve the vault, it may be technically infeasible to locate the curb ramp optimally. It may be possible to widen the crosswalk markings to include the curb ramp.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> What if the curb ramp can be placed over the vault, but the access cover would be located on the curb ramp? <br> Answer: If the access cover must be located on the curb ramp, it should meet the surface requirements of the pedestrian access route.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> One corner of an intersection is being altered by curb and gutter reconstruction and paired curb ramps are being installed as part of this project. The other three corners of the intersection are not being altered. Must curb ramps be provided at the unaltered corners as part of this work? <br> <em>Answer:</em> No. The scope of the project requires curb ramps only at the altered corner.</p>
<p><strong>Sidewalks</strong><br> <em>Question:</em> A project will be undertaken to connect a series of sidewalk segments near a school. Must the existing segments of sidewalk be modified if they do not meet width or cross slope provisions? <br> <em>Answer:</em> Yes, to the maximum extent feasible within the scope of the project. Agencies are not required to expand a planned scope of work to include other items of accessibility.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> A new sidewalk is being built along an existing road that contains driveway access points. Must those driveways be modified if their cross slope exceeds 2%? <br> <em>Answer:</em> Yes, to the maximum extent feasible within the scope of the project.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> A city is rebuilding a sidewalk along Main Street. The distance between the edge of the right-of-way and the existing road does not provide sufficient room for a 4-foot-wide pedestrian access route. Does the municipality have to acquire more right-of-way on private property or narrow the roadway to provide the necessary space?<br> <em>Answer:</em> No, these guidelines do not require the municipality to obtain right-of-way or to narrow roadways. A municipality may decide to do either for other reasons (for instance, the roadway may be narrowed as a larger traffic calming effort or as part of a larger project in the roadway).</p>
<p><strong>Signals</strong><br> <em>Question</em>: Curb ramps are being installed at a signalized intersection as part of a roadway improvement project. Existing pedestrian signals are pedestrian actuated but the pushbuttons are not accessible or placed in accessible locations. Must accessible pedestrian signals be installed at the existing pedestrian signals? <br> <em>Answer: </em>If work on pedestrian pushbuttons is not planned as part of this project, there is no need to expand its scope to include APS.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> The pedestrian signals in a corridor are being replaced with new combined count-down signals. Must APS be included in the new system? <br> <em>Answer:</em> Yes. The installation of a new system is an alteration that requires compliance with the new construction guidelines to the maximum extent feasible. However, the addition of a new feature, such as a countdown face or larger display, to an existing installed system does not require that the scope of work be expanded to include other features.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Count-down signal displays are being added to the existing pedestrian signal heads at an intersection, but the software and signal controller are not being altered. Must APS be installed? <br> <em>Answer:</em> No, simply adding a display to the existing WALK/DON’T WALK signal would not involve the system changes needed to implement APS.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> An intersection is being signalized and will include APS. The installation of stub poles on the existing sidewalks to mount the new pedbuttons will not involve disturbing the roadway or sidewalk. Must curb ramps be installed if none existed? <br> <em>Answer:</em> No. This is a project to install pedbuttons; it is not an alteration to the sidewalk or street that would require the installation of curb ramps, as required by 28 CFR 35.151(e).<br> <br> <em>Question:</em> The pushbutton on an existing pedestrian signal is being replaced with a sturdier model. Must APS be installed? <br> <em>Answer:</em> No, but the new pushbutton must meet applicable requirements (i.e., location, height, operable parts).</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> An intersection with sidewalks and pedestrian signals is being widened to include a right turn lane. Must APS be installed as a consequence of the widening project? <br> <em>Answer:</em> No, installing APS is not within scope of the project. Any new pedestrian pushbuttons installed in the course of the work must meet applicable requirements. Note that this project is an alteration to the street and sidewalk and thus must provide compliant curb ramps.</p>
<p><strong>General</strong><br> <em>Question:</em> The local public transit agency has designated a bus stop by placing a sign in the ground along a roadway with no sidewalk. Must a concrete or other improved surface be installed? <br> <em>Answer:</em> No, the placement of a bus stop sign alone does not require other site improvements. When other site improvements are provided they should meet the applicable access requirements.</p>	</div>

<p><em>Advisory R202.3 Alterations. From the U.S. Department of Justice title III regulation at 28 CFR 36.402 Alterations: "The phrase ‘to the maximum extent feasible,’ … applies to the occasional case where the nature of an existing facility makes it virtually impossible to comply fully with applicable accessibility standards through a planned alteration. In these circumstances, the alteration shall provide the maximum physical accessibility feasible. Any altered features of the facility that can be made accessible shall be made accessible. If providing accessibility in conformance with this section to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs) would not be feasible, the facility shall be made accessible to persons with other types of disabilities (e.g., those who use crutches, those who have impaired vision or hearing, or those who have other impairments)."</em></p>
<p><em>Existing conditions (e.g., underlying terrain, right-of-way availability, underground structures, adjacent developed facilities, drainage, the presence of a notable natural or historic feature) may limit choices in an alterations project. In determining the maximum feasible accessibility that can be achieved for pedestrians with disabilities within a given alterations project, covered entities may consider constructability limits commensurate with those of the project as a whole. </em></p>
<p><em>There is no ‘path-of-travel’ obligation in these guidelines; covered entities shall apply the guidelines to achieve the maximum feasible accessibility within the limits of the planned project boundary or scope. However, the alteration of multiple elements or spaces within a facility may provide a cost-effective opportunity to make the entire facility, or a significant portion of it, accessible. When undertaking right-of-way alterations, jurisdictions should consult their transition plans to determine if related work has been identified as needed to achieve program accessibility in existing facilities at the same location. </em></p>
<p><em>Most rights-of-way work occurs as an alteration in a complex environment also regulated for vehicle operation and safety and subject to the well-established industry practice of applying ‘engineering judgment’. These techniques can also be used to evaluate the feasibility of accessibility solutions. </em></p>

<p><em>Advisory R414.4 Platform and Vehicle Floor Coordination. The height and position of a platform must be coordinated with the floor of the vehicles it serves to minimize the vertical and horizontal gaps, in accordance with the ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Transportation Vehicles (36 CFR part 1192). The vehicle guidelines, divided by bus, van, light rail, rapid rail, commuter rail, intercity rail, are available at www.access-board.gov/transit/html/vguide.htm. The preferred alignment is a high platform, level with the vehicle floor. In some cases, the vehicle guidelines permit use of a low platform in conjunction with a lift or ramp. Most such low platforms must have a minimum height of eight inches above the top of the rail. Some vehicles are designed to be boarded from a street or the sidewalk along the street. The exception permits those boarding areas to be less than eight inches high.</em></p>

<p><em>Advisory R415.1 General. Emerging technologies such as audible sign systems using infrared transmitters and receivers may provide greater accessibility in the transit environment than traditional braille and raised letter signs. The transmitters are placed on or next to print signs and transmit their information to an infrared receiver that is held by a person. By scanning an area, the person will hear the sign. This means that signs can be placed well out of reach of pedestrians, even on parapet walls and on walls beyond barriers. Additionally, such signs can be used to provide wayfinding information that cannot be efficiently conveyed on braille signs.</em></p>
