Committee Meeting Minutes: 

**Summary Minutes (approved Jan 09, 2014)**\
**Rail Vehicles Access Advisory Committee -- 1st Meeting**\
**November 13 and 14, 2013**\
**Washington, DC**

**Wednesday, November 13, 2013**

On behalf of the Access Board, Mr. Christopher Hart opened the first meeting of the Rail Vehicles Access Advisory Committee at 10 a.m. in the Access Board's conference room at 1331 F Street, N.W., room 800, Washington, DC. Mr. Hart welcomed the committee members, alternates, and members of the public and then introduced the Chair of the committee, Mr. Billy Altom. Committee members and others in attendance introduced themselves (see attachment A for attendance). Mr. David Capozzi provided an overview of Access Board programs and services and also welcomed the committee.

Ms. Marsha Mazz reviewed why the Board formed the advisory committee; discussed the types of issues falling within the Board's purview under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); and described how the committee could best serve the Access Board's needs.

Ms. Aromie Noe briefly reviewed the requirement that the Board develop a regulatory assessment to accompany a future proposed rule using the advisory committee's recommendations. Ms. Noe explained that the committee could help with the regulatory assessment by providing, where possible, cost and benefit data with their recommendations. Ms. Lisa Fairhall then reviewed the Federal Advisory Committee Act.

The committee reviewed its draft operating procedures and voted to make several minor changes. They lifted the limitation in Section 4 restricting when an organization, not on the committee, can petition for membership. In an unrelated matter, Mr. Paul Beatty pointed out that in accordance with a Presidential Memorandum no federally registered lobbyist could participate in the work of the committee. However, he indicated that such individuals are not prohibited from attending meetings and providing comment during public commit periods. Following lunch, the committee approved the operating procedures (copy at [www.access-board.gov/rvaac](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/transportation/vehicles/rail-vehicles-access-advisory-committee)).

In accordance with Section 4 of the operating procedures, the committee accepted applications from six organizations seeking committee membership. Mr. Beatty explained that successful applicants, approved by three quarters of the committee members, will have their recommendation for appointment sent to the Access Board Chair for approval. Applicants were asked to describe how their interests are not reflected in the current committee make-up. The applicants were:

1.  American Public Transportation Association
2.  Hearing Loss Association of America
3.  New Jersey Transit
4.  MTA
5.  Q'Straint
6.  Siemens

After a committee discussion on the applications, staff circulated and collected a written ballot. Results were announced the following day after consultation with the Access Board Chair.

Following the balloting, Mr. Altom invited public comment. No commenters came forward.

Next, the committee established the following three meeting dates and times

-   January 9 and 10, 2014 (first day 10 to 5, second day 9 to 3)
-   April 10 and 11, 2014
-   September 11 and 12, 2014

All meetings will be held at 1331 F Street, NW, Room 800, Washington, DC, 20004.

The committee then recessed for the day at 5:15 p.m.

**Thursday, November 14, 2013**

Mr. Altom opened the second day of the meeting at 9:15 a.m. He then announced that at least three quarters of the committee membership had recommended three additional committee members and that they had been approved by the Chair of the Access Board. The new members: Hearing Loss Association of America, New Jersey Transit, and Metropolitan Transportation Authority of the State of New York were asked to take their seats at the table.

Ms. Fairhall briefly reviewed two provisions of the ADA statute which address intercity bi-level dinning cars and number of wheelchair spaces in coach cars. Ms. Melissa Anderson followed by providing an overview of the Access Board's current rail vehicle accessibility guidelines.

Following Ms. Anderson's presentation, Mr. Altom invited everyone on the committee, including members and alternates, to list their issues related to rail access and the current guidelines. Mr. Beatty requested that the committee focus on new construction issues, noting that the committee can also make recommendations for altered and remanufactured vehicles, time permitting. This activity took several hours and continued after lunch. Mr. Altom invited members of the public to add their issues to the list.

The committee decided that the issues list would be refined by Access Board staff and then sent out for committee review and comment. The goal is to create a refined issues list that can be used at the next meeting (January 9 and 10, 2014) by the committee to establish priorities for areas to be addressed in their recommendations to the Access Board. New issues can be added to the list by committee members. See Attachment B for the draft issues list.

The next meeting will be held January 9 and 10, 2014, in the Access Board's conference room. The first day of the meeting will start at 10 a.m. and run to 5 p.m., and the second day will start at 9 a.m. and run to 3 p.m.

The committee adjourned at 2:40 p.m.

## January 9-10, 2014
Committee Meeting Minutes: 

### Summary Minutes --- 2nd Meeting (approved April 10, 2014)\
U.S. Access Board\
Rail Vehicles Access Advisory Committee\
January 9 -- 10, 2014\
Washington, DC

#### Thursday, January 9, 2014

With a quorum present, on behalf of the Access Board, Mr. Christopher Hart opened the second meeting of the Rail Vehicles Access Advisory Committee at 10 a.m. in the Access Board's conference room at 1331 F Street NW, room 800, Washington, DC.  Mr. Hart welcomed the committee members, alternates, and members of the public.  Committee members and others in attendance introduced themselves (see attachment A for attendance).  The committee then approved (certified as accurate) the November 2013 meeting summary minutes.

The committee then reviewed the issues list.  New issue "all announcements in American Sign Language as well as text" was added, and the last issue on the list "standards for websites and smart phones" was removed (as the issue does not fall under the Access Board's Americans with Disabilities Act jurisdiction).  Throughout the remainder of the two-day meeting some other issues were added, edited, or moved to appear under different headings (see attachment B for changes made).

Next, the five educational presentations listed below were made to the committee (copies of the presentation PowerPoints are available at the committee's electronic docket:  [www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=ATBCB-2013-0006](http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=ATBCB-2013-0006)).  A discussion time followed each presentation.

1.  Federal Railroad Administration Presentation (Ms. Melissa Shurland) -- Summary of PRIIA[1](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/transportation/vehicles/rail-vehicles-access-advisory-committee/meeting-minutes-january-2014#ftn1) Next Generation Equipment Committee Accessibility Accommodations and Other Areas for Consideration
2.  Bombardier Transportation Presentation (Mr. André Gagné) -- Toilet Module Footprint
3.  International Centre for Accessible Transportation Presentation (Mr. Uwe Rutenberg) -- Integrated Solutions to Accessible Coach Car Elements
4.  Talgo Presentation (Mr. Joshua Coran) -- A Brief Description of the Three Distinct "Bi-Level" Passenger Car Designs Currently in Use on the US "General System"
5.  Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Presentation (Mr. Glenn Millis) -- 7000 Series Rail Car Accessibility Features

A presentation from the Federal Railroad Administration, titled Rail 101, was rescheduled for the April 2014 meeting, to allow further preparation work.  A lunch break occurred between the second and third presentations.

After the last presentation, the committee began a discussion on how to resolve the rail access issues identified in attachment B.  Mr. Paul Beatty presented an idea to the committee for consideration that involved setting up three subcommittees (communications, circulation, and designated spaces).

Toward the end of the day a time of public comment was allowed.  Mr. Bob Reuter addressed the committee.

The committee then recessed for the day around 5:15 p.m.

#### Friday, January 10, 2014

The second day of the January meeting started around 9:15 a.m.  After further discussion on the subcommittee idea (but no action taken), the committee decided to review the issues list.  During the review, the committee classified the issues as to whether an issue was communication related or spatial in nature, and what vehicle mode (e.g., light rail) it applied to.  These determinations were added to the issue headings in attachment B, and some issues were moved to fall under more appropriate headings.

After lunch, around 1:30 p.m., the committee discussed whether conference calls could be scheduled before the April 2014 meeting on specific issues.  The committee agreed to hold the following conference calls on fixed and variable signage and interior vertical circulation between car levels.

> **Signage** - February 6, 13, and 27, 2014 (1 pm to 3 pm, eastern time).  The February 6 call would provide callers with an understanding of what the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG) would require, if ADAAG was applied to signs on rail vehicles.  Also, review the variable messaging signage requirements in International Code Council/American Standards Institute (ICC/ANSI) standard A117.1 , and review the signage requirements in the current rail guidelines.  This call was not scheduled for discussing the problems in applying ADAAG or ICC/ANSI, but to acquaint callers with the provisions in these two documents as well as the current rail guideline signage provisions.  The February 13 call was tasked with evaluating whether ADAAG and ICC/ANSI signage provisions could be applied to rail vehicles, and if any modifications are necessary.  The February 27 call would be a continuation of the February 13 call, if needed.
>
> **Interior Vertical Circulation** - March 5, 20, 26, 2014 (1 p.m. to 3 p.m., east coast time).  The three calls seek to answer the question - when is an elevator/lift needed to connect levels in a rail vehicle?  The agenda for the calls will be developed by the Access Board.
>
> **Note:**  Any recommendations developed from the six calls are not binding on the full committee and will be presented to the full committee for evaluation at the next committee meeting (April 10 and 11, 2014).

The call-in numbers and related material are to be posted on the Access Board's rail advisory committee website ([www.access-board.gov/rvaac](http://www.access-board.gov/rvaac)) prior to the calls.

At 2:30 p.m. a time of public comment was allowed, with Mr. Michael Chisena, Mr. Gary Talbot, Mr. Paul Grether, and Mr. John Day addressing the committee.

The next meeting will be held April 10 and 11, 2014, in the Access Board's conference room.  The first day of the meeting will start at 10 a.m. and run to 5 p.m., and the second day will start at 9 a.m. and run to 3 p.m.

The committee adjourned at 3 p.m. 

**Note:**  A Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART) system was used in the meeting to provide an accommodation to persons with hearing loss and persons who are deaf.  The CART output was streamed in real-time and available to the public on the internet during the meeting.  The unedited text of the CART output is available at <http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=ATBCB-2013-0006> in the section titled "Supporting Documents" (may have to click "view all") in four documents starting with the words "2nd Meeting - Unedited CART Text".  These documents provide the details of the two-day meeting.

U.S. Access Board\
Rail Vehicles Access Advisory Committee\
April 10 and 11, 2014\
Washington, DC

#### Thursday, April 10, 2014

With a quorum present, Mr. Christopher Hart, Access Board member, opened the third meeting of the Rail Vehicles Access Advisory Committee (RVAAC) at 10 a.m. in the Access Board's conference room at 1331 F Street, N.W., room 800, Washington, DC.  Mr. Hart welcomed committee members, alternates, and members of the public, and asked those in attendance to introduce themselves.  The attendance record is in the Attachment to these minutes.  He then turned the meeting over to the Committee Chair, Mr. Billy Altom.  The committee approved the January 2014 meeting summary minutes as submitted.[¹](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/transportation/vehicles/rail-vehicles-access-advisory-committee/meeting-minutes-april-2014#ftn1)

The committee welcomed Mr. Francis Mascarenhas who replaced Mr. Justin Vonashek as the committee Metra representative, and Mr. Larry Scott who replaced Mr. Ross Capon as the committee representative for the National Association of Railroad Passengers.  For Amtrak, it was reported that Mr. Gary Talbot is the new alternate representative and Ms. June Kailes is the new alternate for the Disabilities Rights Educational Defense Fund.  During the meeting, Mr. Michael Wetherell informed the committee that he could no longer serve on the committee and that Mr. Frank Maldari is now the representative from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of the State of New York and Mr. Gricelda Cespedes would be his alternate.

Mr. Altom provided a brief report on a recommendation by Access Board staff to rename and expand the scope of the existing two subcommittees (Signage and Interior Vertical Circulation) and add two new subcommittees.[²](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/transportation/vehicles/rail-vehicles-access-advisory-committee/meeting-minutes-april-2014#ftn2)  This recommendation was approved by the committee with only one dissenting vote.

The new subcommittees are:

-   Boarding and Alighting
-   Communications (formerly Signage)
-   On-board Circulation and Seating (formerly Interior Vertical Circulation)
-   Rooms and Spaces

The following five educational presentations were made to the committee. A discussion time followed each presentation.

Ms. Terry Pacheco, who had been chair of the Signage subcommittee will chair the Communications subcommittee.  Mr. Blair Slaughter was elected chair of the On-board Circulation and Seating Subcommittee.  Election of chair for the Boarding and Alighting Subcommittee was scheduled for the first subcommittee meeting to be held on April 11, 2014.  The committee agreed to postpone election of the chair of the Rooms and Spaces subcommittee which was not scheduled to meet during the two-day full committee meeting.

Access Board staff recommended the committee establish two additional meeting dates between October 2014 and June 2015.  The committee agreed to add meetings and directed staff to handle the date selection following the meeting and to poll the committee members regarding their availability.

The committee agreed to schedule conference calls for the four subcommittees between the April and September 2014 full committee meetings.  Times for subcommittee meetings will be from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. (eastern time zone).  The dates will, to the extent possible, be on Thursdays.  The committee authorized the Access Board staff to modify the day when necessary to accommodate logistical and administrative needs.  The call dates were to be sent to the committee as soon as possible.

The following five educational presentations were made to the committee.  A discussion time followed each presentation.

During the presentations, members observed that the American Public Transportation Association would be holding a Rail Conference in Montreal, Canada, June 18/19, and also during this conference a workshop, titled "Improving Rail Transit Safety at Platform/Train and Platform/Guideway Interfaces" would take place.  Mr. Uwe Rutenberg reported that the workshop was sponsored by the Transit Cooperative Research Program of the Transportation Research Board.

A lunch break occurred between the second and third presentations.  After the last presentation, the floor was opened for public comment.  With no one desiring to comment, the committee adjourned around 3:40 p.m after which subcommittee meetings took place for the balance of the meeting through April 11.

## September 11-12, 2014
Committee Meeting Minutes:

### Summary Minutes --- 4th Meeting (approved October 20, 2014)\
U.S. Access Board\
Rail Vehicles Access Advisory Committee\
(and subcommittee)\
September 11 and 12, 2014\
Washington, DC

#### Thursday, September 11, 2014 --- Subcommittee Meeting

The two days started around 10:00 a.m. with the Communications Subcommittee holding its eighth meeting, chaired by Ms. Terry Pacheco.  The subcommittee met in the Access Board's conference room at 1331 F Street, N.W., room 800, Washington, DC. This meeting ended around 12:30 p.m.

#### Thursday, September 11, 2014 --- Advisory Committee Meeting

With a quorum present, the fourth meeting of the Rail Vehicles Access Advisory Committee (RVAAC) started around 1:00 p.m. in the Access Board's conference room (see attachment for committee meeting attendance).  After introduction of committee members, alternates, and members of the public, Mr. Billy Altom addressed the following administrative matters. 

First, by a May 9 email, a draft of the April 2014 summary meeting minutes was sent to the committee for review and approval.  Because minutes are required by the Federal Advisory Committee Act to be certified as complete within 90 days of the April committee meeting, the May 9 email asked for approval of the draft April minutes.  A majority of committee members responded with all approving the draft April summary minutes without change.  Therefore, on May 20, the April summary meeting minutes were considered approved and added to the RVAAC website and the RVAAC electronic docket.  Because the next meeting date is more than 90 days away, it was indicated that the committee would be following the same procedures to review and approve the September summary minutes. 

Second, at the April 2014 committee meeting, the Access Board asked the committee to select two additional meeting dates, as it appeared the advisory committee would not complete its work by September 12.  In April, the committee directed the Access Board to send out dates from which the committee members would make selections.  By an email of April 15, date options were presented to the committee.  On April 29, with most committee organizations submitting votes on the dates, the voting was closed.  The vote results were that February 26 and 27 were selected as the first additional meeting date in 2015, with April 23 and 24 selected as the second additional meeting date.  It was recognized that no one two-day period matched everyone's schedule, but the selections represent the best available outcomes. 

Third, due to a recent change in the guidance from the Office of Management and Budget, federally registered lobbyists may serve on this advisory committee under some conditions.  Mr. Altom noted that if committee members had any questions about this change, they should contact Ms. Lisa Fairhall who was present at the meeting.

Mr. Altom formed an editorial working group of subcommittee chairs to start drafting the committee's final report to the Access Board.  It was pointed out that this working group would not establish any position for the full committee and that ultimately, any report developed by the working group must be reviewed and approved by the full committee.  Mr. Altom asked if any committee member was a skilled report writer and desired to participate in the working group.

Mr. Altom noted that although a time of public comment was scheduled for today and tomorrow, the public was reminded that comments may also be submitted to the RVAAC electronic docket at regulations.gov.  He reported that since the last meeting in April, comments have been submitted by Mr. Michael Chisena and, under Ms. Emily Bacque's name, the Bay Area Rapid Transit. 

Mr. Altom indicated he was modifying the agenda and would skip the brief reports from subcommittee chairs and moved into hearing the draft proposal from the Boarding and Alighting Subcommittee, chaired by Ms. Marilyn Golden.  The committee and members of the public provided comment on the proposal to enable the subcommittee to further refine its recommendations. 

Next, Mr. Dennis Cannon, chair of the Rooms and Spaces Subcommittee, presented his subcommittee's proposal to the full committee.  It was noted that the RVAAC website version of its proposal was different from what was provided to the Board staff, but the committee and members of the public still provided comment to enable the subcommittee to further refine its recommendations.  The correct version of the subcommittee's draft proposal has been placed in the RVAAC electronic docket (see Note 1 below). 

Around 4:15 p.m., a time of public comment was allowed.  With no one desiring to comment, the committee held a moment of silence in memory of the September 11 disaster and then, after brief discussions, ended the day's meeting around 4:30 p.m.

#### Friday, September 12, 2014 --- Advisory Meeting (continued)

With a quorum present, the second day of the September meeting started around 9:30 a.m.  The committee heard the draft proposal from the On-board Circulation and Seating Subcommittee, chaired by Mr. Joseph (Blair) Slaughter.  The committee and members of the public provided comment to enable the subcommittee to further refine its recommendations.  Around 10:40 a.m. the discussion stopped to allow Ms. Mary Lamielle to provide public comment on matters not directly related to the subcommittee.  After a break, and excluding a later lunch break, the committee continued its discussions until around 2:45 p.m. when it allowed a time of public comment.  Mr. Bob Reuter and Mr. Don Mebius provided comment. 

At the end of the day, it was confirmed that the regular Thursday, 1:00 p.m. to 3 p.m., subcommittee conference calls would continue from October to January, but some adjustments may be made due to holidays and other attendance issues.

The fourth RVAAC meeting adjourned around 3:00 p.m.  The next RVAAC meeting is scheduled for February 26 and 27, 2015, in the Access Board's conference room.  

**Note 1 -- Draft Proposals.**  Although the subcommittee draft proposals were reviewed by the full committee, no formal actions were taken by the committee regarding the recommendations.  The draft proposals can be found in the RVAAC electronic docket at <http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=ATBCB-2013-0006> in the section titled Supporting Documents (may have to click "view all" and sort by title) under 4th Meeting -- Draft Proposal -- (subcommittee name).  The material for the subcommittee meeting on September 11 is filed separately in Supporting Documents under Communications Subcommittee Meeting #8.

**Note 2 -- CART.**  A Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART) system was used in the committee meeting (and subcommittee meeting) to provide an accommodation to persons with hearing loss and persons who are deaf. The CART output was streamed in real-time and available to the public on the internet. The unedited text of the CART output is available in the RVAAC electronic docket referenced above in the section titled Supporting Documents under 4th Meeting - Unedited CART Text - 2014 Sept (11 or 12). These documents provide the details of the committee meeting. The CART text from the September 11 subcommittee meeting is filed separately in Supporting Documents under Communications Subcommittee Meeting #8.

On October 20, the September summary meeting minutes were considered approved, with some minor editorial corrections, and added to the RVAAC website and the RVAAC electronic docket.  Because the next meeting date is less than 90 days away, Mr. Altom indicated the RVAAC would wait until the April 2015 meeting to approve the minutes from the fifth meeting. 

Second, two RVAAC member organizations designated new representatives.  The Ricon Corporation is now represented by Mr. Dante DeLeo and the National Association of Railroad Passengers is now represented by Mr. Bob Reuter.

Third, since the September 2014 meeting, the subcommittees have had 12 conference calls.  Agendas and materials used in the calls have been placed in the RVAAC electronic docket (see link below). 

Fourth, since the last meeting, one public comment was added to the electronic docket from Rebecca Williford, Disability Rights Advocates, and four from Michael Chisena, MPC Visionary Concepts.

Following administrative matters, Mr. Joseph (Blair) Slaughter, Chair of the On-board Circulation and Seating Subcommittee, led a committee review of the report from his subcommittee.  This review, excluding a lunch break, continued to about 3 p.m. when public comment on the report was solicited.  No one desired to provide comment.

Next, Ms. Marilyn Golden, Chair of the Boarding and Alighting Subcommittee, led a committee review of the report from her subcommittee.  At about 4:30 p.m., the committee stopped its work to allow public comment on the report.  Mr. Michael Chisena provided comment.  Following a short committee discussion about gap fillers, Mr. Chisena again provided comment.

The meeting day ended around 5 p.m.

#### Friday, February 27, 2015 --- Advisory Meeting (continued)

With a quorum present, the second day of the February meeting started around 9:30 a.m.  After introduction of committee members, alternates, and members of the public, Mr. Stanton Hunter and Ms. Monica London made a presentation on the Amtrak/Caltrans Onboard Information System which currently is under development. Time for questions and answers followed.

Next, Ms. Terry Pacheco, Chair of the Communications Subcommittee, led a committee review of the draft report from her subcommittee.  This review continued until about 1 p.m., excluding a short lunch break, when public comment on the report was solicited.  No one desired to comment.

Following this, Mr. Dennis Cannon, Chair of the Rooms and Spaces Subcommittee, led a committee review of the report from his subcommittee. 

Around 2:40 p.m., Ms. Marsha Mazz provided a general overview of next steps for the committee.  These included allowing time for the subcommittee chairs to modify their reports based on the discussions that occurred during the committee reviews, and providing the opportunity for member comments to be submitted on the updated reports which would form the focus of the next meeting in April. 

Following Ms. Mazz's statements, public comment on the Rooms and Spaces report and any other matters pertaining the RVAAC work was solicited.  Mr. Chisena provided comment.

The fifth RVAAC meeting adjourned around 3:00 p.m.  The next RVAAC meeting is scheduled for April 23 and 24, 2015, in the Access Board's conference room.
