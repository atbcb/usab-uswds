Committee Meeting Minutes: November 13-14, 2013
-----------------------------------------------

**Summary Minutes (approved Jan 09, 2014)**\
**Rail Vehicles Access Advisory Committee -- 1st Meeting**\
**November 13 and 14, 2013**\
**Washington, DC**

**Wednesday, November 13, 2013**

On behalf of the Access Board, Mr. Christopher Hart opened the first meeting of the Rail Vehicles Access Advisory Committee at 10 a.m. in the Access Board's conference room at 1331 F Street, N.W., room 800, Washington, DC. Mr. Hart welcomed the committee members, alternates, and members of the public and then introduced the Chair of the committee, Mr. Billy Altom. Committee members and others in attendance introduced themselves (see attachment A for attendance). Mr. David Capozzi provided an overview of Access Board programs and services and also welcomed the committee.

Ms. Marsha Mazz reviewed why the Board formed the advisory committee; discussed the types of issues falling within the Board's purview under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); and described how the committee could best serve the Access Board's needs.

Ms. Aromie Noe briefly reviewed the requirement that the Board develop a regulatory assessment to accompany a future proposed rule using the advisory committee's recommendations. Ms. Noe explained that the committee could help with the regulatory assessment by providing, where possible, cost and benefit data with their recommendations. Ms. Lisa Fairhall then reviewed the Federal Advisory Committee Act.

The committee reviewed its draft operating procedures and voted to make several minor changes. They lifted the limitation in Section 4 restricting when an organization, not on the committee, can petition for membership. In an unrelated matter, Mr. Paul Beatty pointed out that in accordance with a Presidential Memorandum no federally registered lobbyist could participate in the work of the committee. However, he indicated that such individuals are not prohibited from attending meetings and providing comment during public commit periods. Following lunch, the committee approved the operating procedures (copy at [www.access-board.gov/rvaac](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/transportation/vehicles/rail-vehicles-access-advisory-committee)).

In accordance with Section 4 of the operating procedures, the committee accepted applications from six organizations seeking committee membership. Mr. Beatty explained that successful applicants, approved by three quarters of the committee members, will have their recommendation for appointment sent to the Access Board Chair for approval. Applicants were asked to describe how their interests are not reflected in the current committee make-up. The applicants were:

1.  American Public Transportation Association
2.  Hearing Loss Association of America
3.  New Jersey Transit
4.  MTA
5.  Q'Straint
6.  Siemens

After a committee discussion on the applications, staff circulated and collected a written ballot. Results were announced the following day after consultation with the Access Board Chair.

Following the balloting, Mr. Altom invited public comment. No commenters came forward.

Next, the committee established the following three meeting dates and times

-   January 9 and 10, 2014 (first day 10 to 5, second day 9 to 3)
-   April 10 and 11, 2014
-   September 11 and 12, 2014

All meetings will be held at 1331 F Street, NW, Room 800, Washington, DC, 20004.

The committee then recessed for the day at 5:15 p.m.

**Thursday, November 14, 2013**

Mr. Altom opened the second day of the meeting at 9:15 a.m. He then announced that at least three quarters of the committee membership had recommended three additional committee members and that they had been approved by the Chair of the Access Board. The new members: Hearing Loss Association of America, New Jersey Transit, and Metropolitan Transportation Authority of the State of New York were asked to take their seats at the table.

Ms. Fairhall briefly reviewed two provisions of the ADA statute which address intercity bi-level dinning cars and number of wheelchair spaces in coach cars. Ms. Melissa Anderson followed by providing an overview of the Access Board's current rail vehicle accessibility guidelines.

Following Ms. Anderson's presentation, Mr. Altom invited everyone on the committee, including members and alternates, to list their issues related to rail access and the current guidelines. Mr. Beatty requested that the committee focus on new construction issues, noting that the committee can also make recommendations for altered and remanufactured vehicles, time permitting. This activity took several hours and continued after lunch. Mr. Altom invited members of the public to add their issues to the list.

The committee decided that the issues list would be refined by Access Board staff and then sent out for committee review and comment. The goal is to create a refined issues list that can be used at the next meeting (January 9 and 10, 2014) by the committee to establish priorities for areas to be addressed in their recommendations to the Access Board. New issues can be added to the list by committee members. See Attachment B for the draft issues list.

The next meeting will be held January 9 and 10, 2014, in the Access Board's conference room. The first day of the meeting will start at 10 a.m. and run to 5 p.m., and the second day will start at 9 a.m. and run to 3 p.m.

The committee adjourned at 2:40 p.m.

Committee Meeting Minutes: January 9-10, 2014
---------------------------------------------

### Summary Minutes --- 2nd Meeting (approved April 10, 2014)\
U.S. Access Board\
Rail Vehicles Access Advisory Committee\
January 9 -- 10, 2014\
Washington, DC

#### Thursday, January 9, 2014

With a quorum present, on behalf of the Access Board, Mr. Christopher Hart opened the second meeting of the Rail Vehicles Access Advisory Committee at 10 a.m. in the Access Board's conference room at 1331 F Street NW, room 800, Washington, DC.  Mr. Hart welcomed the committee members, alternates, and members of the public.  Committee members and others in attendance introduced themselves (see attachment A for attendance).  The committee then approved (certified as accurate) the November 2013 meeting summary minutes.

The committee then reviewed the issues list.  New issue "all announcements in American Sign Language as well as text" was added, and the last issue on the list "standards for websites and smart phones" was removed (as the issue does not fall under the Access Board's Americans with Disabilities Act jurisdiction).  Throughout the remainder of the two-day meeting some other issues were added, edited, or moved to appear under different headings (see attachment B for changes made).

Next, the five educational presentations listed below were made to the committee (copies of the presentation PowerPoints are available at the committee's electronic docket:  [www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=ATBCB-2013-0006](http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=ATBCB-2013-0006)).  A discussion time followed each presentation.

1.  Federal Railroad Administration Presentation (Ms. Melissa Shurland) -- Summary of PRIIA[1](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/transportation/vehicles/rail-vehicles-access-advisory-committee/meeting-minutes-january-2014#ftn1) Next Generation Equipment Committee Accessibility Accommodations and Other Areas for Consideration
2.  Bombardier Transportation Presentation (Mr. André Gagné) -- Toilet Module Footprint
3.  International Centre for Accessible Transportation Presentation (Mr. Uwe Rutenberg) -- Integrated Solutions to Accessible Coach Car Elements
4.  Talgo Presentation (Mr. Joshua Coran) -- A Brief Description of the Three Distinct "Bi-Level" Passenger Car Designs Currently in Use on the US "General System"
5.  Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Presentation (Mr. Glenn Millis) -- 7000 Series Rail Car Accessibility Features

A presentation from the Federal Railroad Administration, titled Rail 101, was rescheduled for the April 2014 meeting, to allow further preparation work.  A lunch break occurred between the second and third presentations.

After the last presentation, the committee began a discussion on how to resolve the rail access issues identified in attachment B.  Mr. Paul Beatty presented an idea to the committee for consideration that involved setting up three subcommittees (communications, circulation, and designated spaces).

Toward the end of the day a time of public comment was allowed.  Mr. Bob Reuter addressed the committee.

The committee then recessed for the day around 5:15 p.m.

#### Friday, January 10, 2014

The second day of the January meeting started around 9:15 a.m.  After further discussion on the subcommittee idea (but no action taken), the committee decided to review the issues list.  During the review, the committee classified the issues as to whether an issue was communication related or spatial in nature, and what vehicle mode (e.g., light rail) it applied to.  These determinations were added to the issue headings in attachment B, and some issues were moved to fall under more appropriate headings.

After lunch, around 1:30 p.m., the committee discussed whether conference calls could be scheduled before the April 2014 meeting on specific issues.  The committee agreed to hold the following conference calls on fixed and variable signage and interior vertical circulation between car levels.

> **Signage** - February 6, 13, and 27, 2014 (1 pm to 3 pm, eastern time).  The February 6 call would provide callers with an understanding of what the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG) would require, if ADAAG was applied to signs on rail vehicles.  Also, review the variable messaging signage requirements in International Code Council/American Standards Institute (ICC/ANSI) standard A117.1 , and review the signage requirements in the current rail guidelines.  This call was not scheduled for discussing the problems in applying ADAAG or ICC/ANSI, but to acquaint callers with the provisions in these two documents as well as the current rail guideline signage provisions.  The February 13 call was tasked with evaluating whether ADAAG and ICC/ANSI signage provisions could be applied to rail vehicles, and if any modifications are necessary.  The February 27 call would be a continuation of the February 13 call, if needed.
>
> **Interior Vertical Circulation** - March 5, 20, 26, 2014 (1 p.m. to 3 p.m., east coast time).  The three calls seek to answer the question - when is an elevator/lift needed to connect levels in a rail vehicle?  The agenda for the calls will be developed by the Access Board.
>
> **Note:**  Any recommendations developed from the six calls are not binding on the full committee and will be presented to the full committee for evaluation at the next committee meeting (April 10 and 11, 2014).

The call-in numbers and related material are to be posted on the Access Board's rail advisory committee website ([www.access-board.gov/rvaac](http://www.access-board.gov/rvaac)) prior to the calls.

At 2:30 p.m. a time of public comment was allowed, with Mr. Michael Chisena, Mr. Gary Talbot, Mr. Paul Grether, and Mr. John Day addressing the committee.

The next meeting will be held April 10 and 11, 2014, in the Access Board's conference room.  The first day of the meeting will start at 10 a.m. and run to 5 p.m., and the second day will start at 9 a.m. and run to 3 p.m.

The committee adjourned at 3 p.m. 

**Note:**  A Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART) system was used in the meeting to provide an accommodation to persons with hearing loss and persons who are deaf.  The CART output was streamed in real-time and available to the public on the internet during the meeting.  The unedited text of the CART output is available at <http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=ATBCB-2013-0006> in the section titled "Supporting Documents" (may have to click "view all") in four documents starting with the words "2nd Meeting - Unedited CART Text".  These documents provide the details of the two-day meeting.

With a quorum present, Mr. Christopher Hart, Access Board member, opened the third meeting of the Rail Vehicles Access Advisory Committee (RVAAC) at 10 a.m. in the Access Board's conference room at 1331 F Street, N.W., room 800, Washington, DC.  Mr. Hart welcomed committee members, alternates, and members of the public, and asked those in attendance to introduce themselves.  The attendance record is in the Attachment to these minutes.  He then turned the meeting over to the Committee Chair, Mr. Billy Altom.  The committee approved the January 2014 meeting summary minutes as submitted.[¹](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/transportation/vehicles/rail-vehicles-access-advisory-committee/meeting-minutes-april-2014#ftn1)

The committee welcomed Mr. Francis Mascarenhas who replaced Mr. Justin Vonashek as the committee Metra representative, and Mr. Larry Scott who replaced Mr. Ross Capon as the committee representative for the National Association of Railroad Passengers.  For Amtrak, it was reported that Mr. Gary Talbot is the new alternate representative and Ms. June Kailes is the new alternate for the Disabilities Rights Educational Defense Fund.  During the meeting, Mr. Michael Wetherell informed the committee that he could no longer serve on the committee and that Mr. Frank Maldari is now the representative from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of the State of New York and Mr. Gricelda Cespedes would be his alternate.

Mr. Altom provided a brief report on a recommendation by Access Board staff to rename and expand the scope of the existing two subcommittees (Signage and Interior Vertical Circulation) and add two new subcommittees.[²](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/transportation/vehicles/rail-vehicles-access-advisory-committee/meeting-minutes-april-2014#ftn2)  This recommendation was approved by the committee with only one dissenting vote.

The new subcommittees are:

-   Boarding and Alighting
-   Communications (formerly Signage)
-   On-board Circulation and Seating (formerly Interior Vertical Circulation)
-   Rooms and Spaces

The following five educational presentations were made to the committee. A discussion time followed each presentation.

Access Board staff recommended the committee establish two additional meeting dates between October 2014 and June 2015.  The committee agreed to add meetings and directed staff to handle the date selection following the meeting and to poll the committee members regarding their availability.

The committee agreed to schedule conference calls for the four subcommittees between the April and September 2014 full committee meetings.  Times for subcommittee meetings will be from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. (eastern time zone).  The dates will, to the extent possible, be on Thursdays.  The committee authorized the Access Board staff to modify the day when necessary to accommodate logistical and administrative needs.  The call dates were to be sent to the committee as soon as possible.

The following five educational presentations were made to the committee.  A discussion time followed each presentation.

During the presentations, members observed that the American Public Transportation Association would be holding a Rail Conference in Montreal, Canada, June 18/19, and also during this conference a workshop, titled "Improving Rail Transit Safety at Platform/Train and Platform/Guideway Interfaces" would take place.  Mr. Uwe Rutenberg reported that the workshop was sponsored by the Transit Cooperative Research Program of the Transportation Research Board.

A lunch break occurred between the second and third presentations.  After the last presentation, the floor was opened for public comment.  With no one desiring to comment, the committee adjourned around 3:40 p.m after which subcommittee meetings took place for the balance of the meeting through April 11.

The Communications subcommittee meeting #3 took place between 4 and 5 p.m.
