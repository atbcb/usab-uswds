## Introduction

You should file an ABA complaint if you have encountered or are aware of an accessibility barrier at a building or facility covered by the [Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA)]({{ site.baseurl }}/laws/aba.html).  Covered buildings or facilities are those designed, built, or altered with federal dollars or leased by federal agencies after August 12, 1968.  Examples include U.S. post offices, Veterans Affairs medical facilities, national parks, Social Security Administration offices, federal office buildings, U.S. courthouses, and federal prisons.

These facilities must meet [standards for accessible design]({{ site.baseurl }}/aba/), which indicate where access is required and provide detailed specifications for ramps, parking, doors, elevators, restrooms, assistive listening systems, fire alarms, signs, and other accessible building elements.

The Access Board enforces the ABA through the [investigation of complaints]({{ site.baseurl }}/enforcement/investigation.html).

## Filing Methods

ABA complaints can be filed using any of the following methods:

1. [Online ABA Complaint Form]({{ site.baseurl }}/enforcement/complaint.html)
2. E-mail to <enforce@access-board.gov>
3. Fax to 202-272-0081
4. Mail to:
> Compliance and Enforcement Section  
> Office of the General Counsel  
>  U.S. Access Board  
> 1331 F Street NW, Suite 1000  
> Washington, DC  20004-1111  

**Please note that due to office closures caused by Covid-19, we recommend not filing by mail or fax since staff is not present in the office to receive that correspondence.**

**Complaints cannot be filed by phone, but if you are unable to use one of the above filing methods due to a disability, call 202-272-0050 (v)**

## Required and Optional Information

When filing a complaint, you must include the name and address of the building or facility and a brief description of each access problem or barrier you are aware of.  If you wish, you may include photos, relevant supporting documentation, and any information about the facility, such as when it was built or known sources of federal funding.

You may also submit any photographs or other supporting documents with your complaint.

Personal information, including your name, is optional and allows us to keep you informed of the status and results of our investigation. If you provide any personal information, we will not disclose it without your written permission.  If you wish, however, you may file a complaint anonymously.

## Non-ABA Issues

Only file an ABA complaint if you have concerns about accessibility barriers at a covered building. Complaints related to accessibility barriers in State or local government buildings, as well as places of public accommodation (restaurants, hotels, bars, movie theaters, etc.), should be directed to the [United States Department of Justice](https://www.ada.gov/filing_complaint.htm), which enforces the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). For information on other federal laws that address accessibility and protect the rights of people with disabilities, please refer to these [other resources]({{ site.baseurl }}/enforcement/other-resources.html).  If you are concerned about issues unrelated to accessibility (such as Covid-19, stimulus checks, income taxes, health insurance, medical records, or eligibility and/or benefits for Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security), please direct those to the appropriate Federal, State, or local entity.
