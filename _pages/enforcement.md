The United States Access Board enforces the [Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA)]({{ site.baseurl }}/laws/aba.html) of 1968 (ABA), which stands as the first measure by Congress to ensure access to the built environment for people with disabilities.  The law requires that buildings or facilities that were designed, built, or altered with federal dollars or leased by federal agencies after August 12, 1968, be accessible.  Facilities that predate the law generally are not covered, but alterations or leases undertaken after the law took effect can trigger coverage.

The law covers a wide range of facilities, including U.S. post offices, Veterans Affairs medical facilities, national parks, Social Security Administration offices, federal office buildings, U.S. courthouses, and federal prisons.  It also applies to non-government facilities that have received federal funding, such as certain schools, public housing, and mass transit systems.

The ABA requires that covered buildings or facilities meet [standards for accessible design]({{ site.baseurl }}/aba/), which indicate where access is required and provide detailed specifications for ramps, parking, doors, elevators, restrooms, assistive listening systems, fire alarms, signs, and other accessible building elements. 

The Access Board enforces the ABA through the [investigation of complaints]({{ site.baseurl }}/enforcement/investigation.html).

If you believe that you have encountered an architectural barrier at an ABA-covered facility, you may file a complaint with the Access Board.  We encourage you to use our  [Online ABA Complaint Form]({{ site.baseurl }}/enforcement/complaint.html), but you may also file a complaint by e-mailing  enforce@access-board.gov or sending it by mail to:
>Compliance and Enforcement Section  
>U.S. Access Board  
>1331 F Street, NW, Suite 1000,  
>Washington, DC  20004  



>**Please note that due to office closures caused by Covid-19, we recommend not filing by mail or fax since staff is not present in the office to receive that correspondence.**

When filing a complaint, be sure to include the name and address of the building or facility and a brief description of each access problem or barrier you encountered at that building or facility. Additional information about the facility, such as when it was built or known sources of federal funding, is helpful but not necessary. You may also submit any photographs or other supporting documents with your complaint.

Personal information, including your name, is optional and allows us to keep you informed of the status and results of our investigation. If you provide any personal information, we will not disclose it without your written permission. If you wish, however, you may file a complaint anonymously.

If you are concerned about other types of accessibility not covered by the ABA, see [Other Resources]({{ site.baseurl }}/enforcement/other-resources.html) for more information.
