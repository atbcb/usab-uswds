### Introduction

The Access Board enforces accessibility standards issued under the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA).  The ABA requires that buildings or facilities that were constructed or altered by or on behalf of the United States, or leased or financed in whole or in part by the United States, after August 12, 1968, be accessible to individuals with physical disabilities.  Anyone can submit a complaint about accessibility barriers at buildings or facilities.

> **NOTE:**  Only use our Online ABA Complaint Form if you are filing an Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) complaint.  Complaints related to accessibility barriers in State or local government buildings, as well as places of public accommodation (restaurants, hotels, bars, movie theaters, etc.), should be directed to the [United States Department of Justice](https://www.ada.gov/filing_complaint.htm), which enforces the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).  For information on other federal laws that address accessibility and protect the rights of people with disabilities, please refer to these [other resources]({{ site.baseurl }}/enforcement/other-resources.html).  If you are concerned about issues unrelated to accessibility (such as Covid-19, stimulus checks, income taxes, health insurance, medical records, or eligibility and/or benefits for Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security), please direct those to the appropriate Federal, State, or local entity.

### Instructions

The Online ABA Complaint Form consists of five sections:  (1) Building or Facility Information; (2) Accessibility Barriers; (3) Complainant Information; (4) Review and Submit; and (5) Confirmation.  _Please note that the form has no "save" function and must be completed in one session._
