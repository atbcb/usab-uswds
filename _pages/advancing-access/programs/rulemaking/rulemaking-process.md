### Access Board Rulemaking Process

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and several other laws, the Access Board develops guidelines and standards for the built environment, transportation systems, information and communication technologies, and medical diagnostic equipment. These include the:

* ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities
* ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Transportation Vehicles
* Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) Accessibility Guidelines
* Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards (Section 508)
* Telecommunications Act Accessibility Guidelines
* Medical Diagnostic Equipment Accessibility Standards

### How the Board Develops Guidelines and Standards

In developing its guidelines and standards, the Board follows a process common to most federal regulations that provides the public an opportunity for comment. It has become standard practice for the Board to organize an advisory committee or regulatory negotiation committee as part of this process. Such committees allow stakeholders and interested parties to develop consensus recommendations on the substance of a rule. Board rules must be cleared by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in proposed and final form before they can be published. OMB usually is allotted 90 days to complete its review. The Board also must prepare a regulatory assessment that estimates the costs and other impacts of a rule. 

These are the typical steps of a Board rulemaking:

> 1. Create an advisory committee to develop consensus recommendations on the rule;
> 2. Draft a proposed rule based on the committee’s recommendations and a preliminary regulatory assessment and submit to OMB for clearance;
> 3. Publish the proposed rule in the Federal Register for public comment; hold public hearings during the comment period (usually 90 – 120 days);
> 4. Review public comments and revise the rule accordingly;
> 5. Submit the final rule and regulatory assessment to OMB for clearance;
> 6. Publish the final rule in the Federal Register.
