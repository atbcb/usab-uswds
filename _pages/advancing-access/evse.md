### Background

In July 2022, in partnership with the Department of Transportation, the Access Board published a [Technical Assistance Document]({{ site.baseurl }}/ta/tad/ev/) that addresses existing requirements and new recommendations for making electric vehicle (EV) charging stations accessible. This Access Board [news article]({{ site.baseurl }}/news/2022/07/21/u-s-access-board-issues-design-recommendations-for-accessible-electric-vehicle-charging-stations/) includes additional background information.

In May 2023, the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation hosted a webinar on [Designing for Accessible EV Charging Stations](https://driveelectric.gov/webinars/accessibility), where Access Board staff presented on the accessibility guidelines and best practices in the Technical Assistance Document.

The [Boardâ€™s Spring 2024 Unified Agenda](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaMain?operation=OPERATION_GET_AGENCY_RULE_LIST&currentPub=true&agencyCode=&showStage=active&agencyCd=3014)
includes a notice of proposed rulemaking on accessibility guidelines for EV charging stations.

More information [about the Board's Rulemaking Process]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/rulemaking.html) and the [Administrative Procedure Act (APA)](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/laws/administrative-procedure) is available.
