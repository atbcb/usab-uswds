Accessibility specialists are available to answer questions on accessibility as it relates to the built environment, outdoor sites, streets and sidewalks, transportation vehicles and vessels, information and communication technology, and medical diagnostic equipment.

The Board regularly provides in-person and virtual trainings on its guidelines and standards upon request. Visit the Board's [Training page](https://www.access-board.gov/webinars/training.html) or send an email to <training@access-board.gov> for more information.
