### Tribal Nations

On January 26, 2021, the [Memorandum on Tribal Consultation and Strengthening Nation-to-Nation Relationships](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/29/2021-02075/tribal-consultation-and-strengthening-nation-to--nation-relationships) was published in the Federal Register. The Memorandum directs federal agencies to ensure that “Tribal sovereignty and self-governance, commitment to fulfilling Federal trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribal Nations, and regular, meaningful, and robust consultation with Tribal Nations are the cornerstones of Federal Indian policy.” In 2021, the Access Board developed a [plan of actions]({{ site.baseurl }}/outreach/tribal-nations/) in its outreach to Tribal Nations.
