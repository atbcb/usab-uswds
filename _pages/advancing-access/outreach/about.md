Part of President Biden’s [Executive Order 14035](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/25/executive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce/) *Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) in the Federal Workforce* calls on federal agencies to ensure that their facilities are fully accessible to employees with disabilities as required by the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA). Visit the Access Board's [DEIA page]({{ site.baseurl }}/deia/about/) for more information on its DEIA Strategic Plan and a set of recommendations and resources to aid agencies.

### Tribal Nations

On January 26, 2021, President Biden issued a [Memorandum on Tribal Consultation and Strengthening Nation-to-Nation Relationships](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/26/memorandum-on-tribal-consultation-and-strengthening-nation-to-nation-relationships/). The Memorandum directs federal agencies to ensure that “Tribal sovereignty and self-governance, commitment to fulfilling Federal trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribal Nations, and regular, meaningful, and robust consultation with Tribal Nations are the cornerstones of Federal Indian policy.” In 2021, the Access Board developed a [plan of actions]({{ site.baseurl }}/outreach/tribal-nations/) in its outreach to Tribal Nations.
