The inability to use oneâ€™s wheelchair on airplanes makes air travel very difficult, if not impossible, for many people with disabilities. Among other challenges, it requires multiple transfers between boarding chairs and aircraft seats, posing injury risks. To address these challenges, the Access Board commissioned a [study](https://www.access-board.gov/aircraft/) to assess the feasibility of equipping aircraft with securement systems and developed onboard wheelchair voluntary guidelines.  In addition, the Access Board is developing [volunatry guidelines](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/08/20/2019-17873/advisory-guidelines-for-aircraft-onboard-wheelchairs) to improve the usability and reliably of onboard wheelchairs on aircraft.

In developing its guidelines and standards, the Access Board follows a process common to most federal regulations that provides the public an opportunity for comment. Visit the Access Board's [Rulemaking Process page]({{ site.baseurl }}/rulemaking-process/) and [Rulemaking History page]({{ site.baseurl }}/rulemaking-history/) for more details.
