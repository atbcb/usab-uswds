## Active and Upcoming Rulemakings

### [Medical Diagnostic Equipment](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/ATBCB-2022-0002)

The Access Board issued a final rule establishing Accessibility Standards for Medical Diagnostic Equipment in January 2017.  The Standards set forth minimum technical criteria to ensure that medical diagnostic equipment used by health care providers (such as examination tables, weight scales, imaging equipment) are accessible to individuals with disabilities.  One of the areas covered by these Standards is the adjustability of transfer surfaces for certain types of diagnostic equipment, including provisions for high, low, and intermediate transfer heights.  The low transfer height was temporarily set as a range (i.e., 17-19 inches) with an accompanying 5-year sunset period, during which time it was expected that the Board would promulgate a final, single specification for the low transfer height position.  For several reasons, however, the Board was not able to issue this final standard.  We thus intend to publish a direct final rule that extends the sunset date for an additional five years.  The Board intends to finalize the low transfer height provision within the five-year extension.

### [Public Rights-of-Way](https://www.access-board.gov/prowag/)

This rulemaking would establish accessibility guidelines to ensure that sidewalks and pedestrian facilities in the public right-of-way are accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. The U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Department of Transportation, and other federal agencies are expected to adopt the accessibility guidelines for pedestrian facilities in the public right-of-way and for shared use paths, as enforceable standards in separate rulemakings for the construction and alteration of facilities covered by the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA).

### [Self-service Transaction Machines]({{ site.baseurl }}/sstms/)

This rulemaking would amend the Access Boardâ€™s existing accessibility guidelines for buildings and facilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) to include guidelines for the accessibility of fixed self-service transaction machines, self-service kiosks, information transaction machines, and point-of-sale devices.  The U.S. Department of Transportation and U.S. Department of Justice are expected, via separate rulemakings, to adopt these amended guidelines as enforceable standards for devices and equipment covered by the ADA.

## Rulemaking Process and History

In developing its guidelines and standards, the Access Board follows a process common to most federal regulations that provides the public an opportunity for comment.
