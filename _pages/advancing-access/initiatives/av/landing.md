[![Inclusive Design of Autonomous Vehicles: A Public Dialog; Summary Report cover page, U.S. Access Board, July 2021](./images/av-report-cvr.jpg "link to report")](./report.html){: .img-right-border }

Self-driving or “autonomous” vehicles stand to revolutionize road transportation in the U.S. and around the world.&nbsp;
Their cutting-edge technologies and engineering innovations have the potential to significantly expand transit options for many people, including those with disabilities.&nbsp;
It is important that autonomous vehicles (AVs) are designed to be inclusive of everyone.   

In the spring of 2021, the U.S. Access Board hosted a four-part series of virtual meetings on making AVs accessible to passengers with disabilities.&nbsp;
The Board provided an open forum where members of the public and stakeholders can discuss considerations, challenges, and solutions in designing accessible AVs.&nbsp;
The sessions covered accessibility for passengers with mobility, sensory, or cognitive disabilities.&nbsp;
The sessions were free and open to the public.&nbsp;
Attendees were able to pose questions and share comments, suggestions, and information. 

The Board undertook this initiative jointly with other agencies, including the Department of Labor’s Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP) and the Department of Health and Human Service’s Administration for Community Living. 

A summary report on the forum is [available online](./report.html).
