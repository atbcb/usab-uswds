## Rulemaking

The Access Board takes on regulatory initiatives to develop accessibility guidelines and standards.  Visit [Access Board Rulemaking Process]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/rulemaking.html) to learn how the board develops guidelines and standards, some historical background, and a listing of final rules.  The Access Board's [Unified Agenda](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaMain?operation=OPERATION_GET_AGENCY_RULE_LIST&currentPub=true&agencyCode=&showStage=active&agencyCd=3014) is available from the Office of Management and Budget. 

### Self-Service Transaction Machines

[Self-Service Transaction Machines]({{ site.baseurl }}/sstm/) (SSTMs) and self-service kiosks are now a common feature in places of public accommodation, government offices, and other facilities.  They allow customers to conduct an expanding range of transactions and functions independently.  However, SSTMs and self-service kiosks have long posed accessibility barriers to people with disabilities, particularly those who are blind or have low vision.

### Electric Vehicle Charging Stations

[Electric Vehicle Charging Stations]({{ site.baseurl }}/evse/) are becoming commonplace with the rising production and use of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles and it is expected that the installation and use of Electric Vechicle (EV) charging stations will continue to expand.  In partnership with the Department of Transportation, the Access Board issued a [technical assistance document]({{ site.baseurl }}/ta/tad/ev/) that addresses existing requirements and new recommendations for making EV charging stations accessible.

## Initiatives

### Air Travel

The inability to use oneâ€™s wheelchair on airplanes makes air travel very difficult, if not impossible, for many people with disabilities.  Among other challenges, it requires multiple transfers between boarding chairs and aircraft seats, posing injury risks.  Visit the Access Board's [Aircraft page]({{ site.baseurl }}/aircraft/) to learn more about improving the usability and reliably of onboard wheelchairs on aircraft.

### Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to advance accessibility, but it can also create barriers for people with disabilities. Visit the Access Board's [AI page]({{ site.baseurl }}/ai/) for more information.

### Autonomous Vehicles

Self-driving cars, shuttles, and other vehicles stand to revolutionize transportation and have the potential to dramatically expand transit options for people with disabilities.  Their cutting-edge technologies and engineering innovations have the potential to significantly expand transit options for many people, including those with disabilities.  It is important that autonomous vehicles (AVs) are designed to be inclusive of everyone. Visit the Access Board's [AV page]({{ site.baseurl }}/av/) for more information.
