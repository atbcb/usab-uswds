## Rulemaking

The Access Board takes on regulatory initiatives to develop accessibility guidelines and standards. Visit the Access Board's [Rulemaking page]({{ site.baseurl }}//rulemaking/about/) to learn about the process, history, and active and upcoming rulemaking. The Access Board's [Unified Agenda](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaMain?operation=OPERATION_GET_AGENCY_RULE_LIST&currentPub=true&agencyCode=&showStage=active&agencyCd=3014&csrf_token=4477D73C38800DD64CF55ADB1768D8D45A731BE31E15AB2A267391786B5743BB6B29078DCC57BFFFD1D816392F7FE84DBA51) is also available on Office of Management and Budget's website. 

## Initiatives

### Air Travel

The inability to use oneâ€™s wheelchair on airplanes makes air travel very difficult, if not impossible, for many people with disabilities. Among other challenges, it requires multiple transfers between boarding chairs and aircraft seats, posing injury risks. Visit the Access Board's [Aircraft page]({{ site.baseurl }}/aircraft/) to learn more about improving the usability and reliably of onboard wheelchairs on aircraft.

### Autonomous Vehicles

Self-driving cars, shuttles, and other vehicles stand to revolutionize transportation and have the potential to dramatically expand transit options for people with disabilities. Their cutting-edge technologies and engineering innovations have the potential to significantly expand transit options for many people, including those with disabilities. It is important that autonomous vehicles (AVs) are designed to be inclusive of everyone. Visit the Access Board's [AV page]({{ site.baseurl }}/av/) for more information.

### Electric Vehicle Charging Stations

Electric vehicles (EV) are becoming more common on America's roads, and they require public charging stations for long-distance traveling. It is crucical that these charging stations be accessible for people with disabilities. The Access Board is partnering with Department of Transportation to develop guidance on making EV charging stations accessible.

### Medical Diagnostic Equipment

The Access Board issued a [Direct Final Rule](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/ATBCB-2022-0002) (DFR) extending the sunset provision regarding the specification for low transfer heights for three years. On May 12, 2022, the Access Board will hold a virtual public information meeting on accessible medical diagnostic equipment (MDE) and the adjustability of transfer surfaces for patients who use wheelchairs. Visit the Board's [news release](https://www.access-board.gov/news/2022/04/13/u-s-access-board-to-host-virtual-public-meeting-on-low-transfer-surface-height-for-medical-diagnostic-equipment/) for more information.

### Self-service Transaction Machines

Self-service transaction machines (SSTMs) and self-service kiosks are now a common feature in places of public accommodation, government offices, and other facilities. They allow customers to conduct an expanding range of transactions and functions independently. However, SSTMs and self-service kiosks have long posed accessibility barriers to people with disabilities, particularly those who are blind or have low vision. Visit the Access Board's [SSTMs page]({{ site.baseurl }}/sstms/) for more information.
