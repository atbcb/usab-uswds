## U.S. Access Board Memorandum of Understanding with American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) and Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT)

### The Partners

The Access Board is an independent federal agency that promotes equality for people with disabilities through leadership in accessible design and the development of accessibility guidelines and standards. Created in 1973 to ensure access to federally funded facilities, the Access Board is a leading source of information on accessible design. The Access Board develops and maintains design criteria for the built environment, transit vehicles, public right-of-way, information and communication technology, and medical diagnostic equipment under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and other laws. It also provides technical assistance and training on these requirements and on accessible design and continues to enforce accessibility standards that apply to federally funded facilities under the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA).

The American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) is a national disability-led and cross-disability rights organization, promoting equal opportunity, economic power, independent living, and political participation for over 60 million Americans with disabilities. 

The Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization leading the advancement of civil rights and civil liberties in the digital age. CDT is at the forefront of discussions with policymakers and companies about responsible technology practices and conducts research and public advocacy to ensure artificial intelligence and other technology develops in a manner that is consistent with human rights and democratic values. 

### The Collaboration

The Access Board, AAPD, and CDT believe there is great value in establishing a collaborative relationship to engage with the disability and technology communities. Our goal is to communicate with the disability community to obtain input on equity and access to artificial intelligence (AI), and to connect with technology entities to integrate disability awareness and accessibility needs within mainstream technology conversations, policies, and practices. 

The Access Board, AAPD, and CDT recognize that they are an integral part of a national effort to promote the safe, equitable, and accessible development and implementation of artificial intelligence.

### Activities

Access Board, AAPD and CDT agree to work together to help ensure that people with disabilities benefit from AI while being protected from its risks. Areas of focus will include biometric discrimination, surveillance, maintenance of data privacy, and algorithmic governance and fairness. Potential activities may include:

1. Establishing opportunities that promote solidarity, relationship-building, information-sharing across disability and technology communities.
2. Identifying and developing possible solutions to potential or existing civil rights concerns, including:
 * accessibility barriers,  
 * risks and benefits of AI, for example, in using biometric data as an input.
3. Providing information, technical assistance, and access to resources that will enable disability and technology communities to promote and create safe, equitable, and accessible artificial intelligence. 

### Implementation

An implementation team comprising representatives of the Access Board, AAPD, and CDT will meet to develop a plan of action, determine working procedures, and identify the roles and responsibilities of the participants. In addition, they will meet at least three times per year, either in person or virtually, to track and share information on activities and results in achieving the goals and objectives of the goals and objectives of this memorandum.
