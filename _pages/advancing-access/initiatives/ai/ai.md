## Background

The [Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/) tasks the Access Board with several actions to help address equity and accessibility with respect to AI. To aid in these goals, the Access Board signed a [Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)]({{ site.baseurl }}/ai-mou/) on Wednesday, May 15, 2024, with the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) and the Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT). This collaborative partnership seeks to help ensure that people with disabilities benefit from AI while being protected from its risks.

The [American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD)](https://www.aapd.com/) is a national disability-led and cross-disability rights organization, promoting equal opportunity, economic power, independent living, and political participation for over 60 million Americans with disabilities.

The [Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT)](https://cdt.org/) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization leading the advancement of civil rights and civil liberties in the digital age. CDT is at the forefront of discussions with policymakers and companies about responsible technology practices and conducts research and public advocacy to ensure artificial intelligence and other technology develops in a manner that is consistent with human rights and democratic values.

### Memorandum of Understanding

[The MOU]({{ site.baseurl }}/ai-mou/) will ensure that the Access Board collaborates with AAPD and CDT to develop and implement three key activities within their partnership that include:

- Establishing opportunities that promote solidarity, relationship-building and information sharing across disability and technology communities.
- Identifying and developing possible solutions to potential or existing civil rights concerns, accessibility barriers, and risks of AI.
- Providing information, technical assistance, and access to resources that will enable disability and technology communities to promote and create safe, equitable, and accessible artificial intelligence.

## Upcoming Events

A key element of the MOU is launching an informative and collaborative AI series that will include information sessions, public hearings, and sharing best practices. The **Developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) Equity, Access & Inclusion for All Series** is the first step toward these goals. As part of this series, the Access Board is holding public hearings with members of the disability community, Federal Agency AI leaders, and AI practitioners. In total, three virtual hearing sessions will take place: two for the disability community (on August 8) and one for federal agency and AI industry practitioners (on August 22).

The hearings support the Access Board’s work in fulfilling the Executive Order on the Use of Artificial Intelligence to engage with disability community members and AI practitioners to learn about the risks and benefits of AI, and to issue recommendations and technical assistance to promote equity, accessibility, and inclusion for all.
