## Background

Former [EO 14110](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/01/2023-24283/safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence), Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, tasked the Access Board with several actions to help address equity and accessibility with respect to AI. To aid in these goals, the Access Board signed a [Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)]({{ site.baseurl }}/ai-mou/) on Wednesday, May 15, 2024, with the [American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD)](https://www.aapd.com/) and the [Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT)](https://cdt.org/). As EO 14110 has been rescinded by [EO 14148](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/28/2025-01901/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions), Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions, the MOU was ended on February 12, 2024, by the Access Board.

## Past Events

A key element of the MOU was launching an informative and collaborative AI series that included information sessions, public hearings, and sharing best practices. As part of this series, the Access Board held public hearings with members of the disability community, Federal Agency AI leaders, and AI practitioners. In total, three virtual hearing sessions took place: two for the disability community (on August 8, 2024) and one for federal agency and AI industry practitioners (on August 22, 2024).

In addition to the virtual hearings, members of the public were invited to submit written comments via the [docket on Regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/ATBCB-2024-0005). Archives of all previous sessions, including an introductory presentation on July 9, 2024 and a closing session on January 14, 2025, can be found below.
