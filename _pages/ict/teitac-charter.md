App. 2, and the administrative guidelines issued by the General Services Administration's Committee Management Secretariat, 41 C.F.R. Part 101 6.

SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES:** The Committee shall advise the Access Board on issues related to revising and updating accessibility guidelines for telecommunications equipment and customer premises equipment and accessibility standards for electronic and information technology. The Committee shall act solely in an advisory capacity to the Access Board and shall neither exercise any program management responsibility nor make decisions directly affecting the matters on which it provides advice.

**5\. DUTIES AND FUNCTIONS:** Consistent with the scope and objectives described in paragraph 4 of this charter, the Committee is authorized to make recommendations to the Access Board on:

> (e) contents of the revised and updated guidelines and standards.

**6\. MEMBERSHIP:** The membership will be balanced in terms of points of view represented, including Federal agencies; the telecommunications and electronic and information technology industry, including manufacturers; organizations representing the access needs of individuals with disabilities; representatives from other countries and international standards setting organizations; and other organizations affected by the accessibility guidelines and standards. Representatives of each of these interests shall be selected by the Chairperson of the Access Board and appointed as Committee members for the duration of the Committee's existence.

**7\. SUBCOMMITTEES:** The Committee may form subcommittees for any purpose consistent with this charter. The subcommittees shall report to the Committee.

Meetings shall be conducted and records of the proceedings kept, as required by applicable laws and regulations.

**10\. COMPENSATION OF MEMBERS:** The Access Board will not compensate Committee members for their service. Committee members will be responsible for their own expenses for participation in the Committee, except that the Access Board may pay for a member's reasonable travel expenses if the member certifies a lack of adequate financial resources to participate in the Committee and the Access Board determines that the member's participation in the Committee is necessary to assure adequate representation of the various interests potentially affected by the accessibility guidelines and standards.
