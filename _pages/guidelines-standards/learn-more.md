The U.S. Access Board is a federal agency that promotes equality for people with disabilities through leadership in accessible design and the development of accessibility guidelines and standards for the built environment, transportation, communication, medical diagnostic equipment, and information technology.

Communications & IT
Access to information and communication technology (ICT) is addressed by Board standards and guidelines issued under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and Section 255 of the Communications Act.  The Board jointly updated its Section 508 Standards and Section 255 Guidelines in January 2017.

- Section 508 Standards and Section 255 Guidelines for ICT (Updated) 

Buildings & Sites
Standards issued under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) address access in new construction and alterations to state and local government facilities, places of public accommodation, and commercial facilities. Similar standards apply under the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) to facilities funded by the federal government.  The Board issued supplementary guidelines for emergency transportable housing in 2014 that are not yet part of the ADA or ABA Standards.

Access to recreation facilities, including play areas, swimming pools, sports facilities, fishing piers, boating facilities, golf courses, and amusement rides is addressed in the ADA and ABA standards. The ABA Standards also include provisions for trails, picnic and camping areas, viewing areas, and beach access routes on  federal lands.
