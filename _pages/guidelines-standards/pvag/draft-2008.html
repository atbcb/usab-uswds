<h2 id="chapter1">Chapter 1:&nbsp; Application and Administration</h2>
<p><strong>V101 Purpose</strong></p>
<p><strong>V101.1 General.</strong>&nbsp; This document contains scoping and technical requirements for <em>accessibility</em> to passenger vessels by individuals with disabilities.&nbsp; The requirements are to be applied during the design, construction, <em>additions</em> to, and <em>alteration</em> of <em>facilities</em> and <em>elements</em> on passenger vessels to the extent required by regulations issued by Federal agencies under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).</p>
<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V101.1 General.</strong>&nbsp; In addition to the requirements contained in this document, covered entities must comply with the regulations issued by the Department of Justice (see 28 CFR parts 35 and 36) and the Department of Transportation (see 49 CFR parts 37 and 39) under the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p><strong>V101.2 Effect on Removal of Barriers in Existing Facilities.</strong>&nbsp; This document does not address existing passenger vessels unless <em>altered</em> at the discretion of a covered entity.&nbsp; The Department of Justice has authority over existing passenger vessels that are subject to the requirement for removal of barriers under title III of the ADA.&nbsp; Any determination that this document applies to existing passenger vessels subject to the barrier removal requirement is solely within the discretion of the Department of Justice and is effective only to the extent required by regulations issued by the Department of Justice.</p>
<p><strong>V102 Dimensions for Adults and Children.</strong>&nbsp; The technical requirements are based on adult dimensions and anthropometrics.&nbsp; In addition, this document includes technical requirements based on children’s dimensions and anthropometrics for drinking fountains, water closets, toilet compartments, lavatories and sinks, and tables and counters.</p>
<p><strong>V103 Equivalent Facilitation.</strong>&nbsp; Nothing in these requirements prevents the use of designs, products, or technologies as alternatives to those prescribed, provided they result in substantially equivalent or greater <em>accessibility</em> and usability.</p>
<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V103 Equivalent Facilitation.</strong>&nbsp; The responsibility for demonstrating equivalent facilitation in the event of a challenge rests with the covered entity.&nbsp; With the exception of transit facilities, which are covered by regulations issued by the Department of Transportation, there is no process for certifying that an alternative design provides equivalent facilitation.</p>
<p><strong>V104 Standard Practices</strong></p>
<p><strong>V104.1 Dimensions.</strong>&nbsp; Dimensions that are not stated as “maximum” or “minimum” are absolute.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>V104.1.1 Construction and Manufacturing Tolerances.</strong>&nbsp; All dimensions are subject to conventional industry tolerances except where the requirement is stated as a range with specific minimum and maximum end points.</p>
<div class="advisory">
<p class="first"><strong>Advisory V104.1.1 Construction and Manufacturing Tolerances.</strong>&nbsp; Conventional industry tolerances recognized by this provision include those for field conditions and those that may be a necessary consequence of a particular manufacturing process.&nbsp; Recognized tolerances are not intended to apply to design work.</p>
<p>It is good practice when specifying dimensions to avoid specifying a tolerance where dimensions are absolute.&nbsp; For example, if this document requires “1½ inches,” avoid specifying “1½ inches plus or minus X inches.”</p>
<p>Where the requirement states a specified range, such as in Section V609.4 where grab bars must be installed between 33 inches and 36 inches above the deck surface, the range provides an adequate tolerance and therefore no tolerance outside of the range at either end point is permitted.</p>
<p>Where a requirement is a minimum or a maximum dimension that does not have two specific minimum and maximum end points, tolerances may apply.&nbsp; Where an element is to be installed at the minimum or maximum permitted dimension, such as “15 inches minimum” or “5 pounds maximum”, it would not be good practice to specify “5 pounds (plus X pounds) or 15 inches (minus X inches).” Rather, it would be good practice to specify a dimension less than the required maximum (or more than the required minimum) by the amount of the expected field or manufacturing tolerance and not to state any tolerance in conjunction with the specified dimension.</p>
<p class="last">Specifying dimensions in design in the manner described above will better ensure that facilities, spaces and elements on passenger vessels accomplish the level of accessibility intended by these requirements.&nbsp; It will also more often produce an end result of strict and literal compliance with the stated requirements and eliminate enforcement difficulties and issues that might otherwise arise.&nbsp; Information on specific tolerances may be available from industry or trade organizations and published references.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>V104.1.2 Slopes.</strong>&nbsp; All slopes are measured when the passenger vessel is in a static condition with full load design trim and heel.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>V104.2 Calculation of Percentages.</strong>&nbsp; Where the required number of <em>elements</em> or <em>facilities</em> to be provided is determined by calculations of ratios or percentages and remainders or fractions result, the next greater whole number of such <em>elements</em> or <em>facilities</em> shall be provided.&nbsp; Where the determination of the required size or dimension of an <em>element</em> or <em>facility</em> involves ratios or percentages, rounding down for values less than one half shall be permitted.</p>
<p><strong>V104.3 Figures.</strong>&nbsp; Unless specifically stated otherwise, figures are provided for informational purposes only.</p>

<p class="exception"><strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp; Non-fixed features of a passenger vessel shall not be required to comply with this document.</p>
<div class="advisory">
<p class="first"><strong>Advisory V201.1 Scope.</strong>&nbsp; The requirements are to be applied to all areas of a passenger vessel unless exempted, or where scoping limits the number of spaces and elements required to comply with this document.</p>
<p>Example 1 (Exempted Spaces).&nbsp; Areas intended for use only by employees are not required to comply with this document (V203.2).</p>
<p>Example 2 (Space Scoping).&nbsp; Not all clustered single user toilet rooms must comply with this document (V213.2 Exception 4).</p>
<p class="last">Example 3 (Element Scoping).&nbsp; Operable parts provided in passenger areas must comply with this document (V205.1), but the operable parts in passenger areas intended for use only by employees are not required to comply with this document (V205.1 Exception 1).</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>V201.1.1 Large Vessels.</strong>&nbsp; Passenger vessels permitted to carry more than 150 passengers or more than 49 overnight passengers shall comply with Chapters 1 through 10.</p>
<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V201.1.1 Large Vessels.</strong>&nbsp; For US Flag passenger vessels, the US Coast Guard (USCG) determines the number of passengers a vessel is permitted to carry.&nbsp; This information is recorded in the vessel’s certificate of inspection (COI) which is required to be carried onboard the vessel.&nbsp; Under USCG regulations, it is possible that a vessel could be capable of carrying more passengers then the COI allows.&nbsp; However, the vessel owner may certificate a vessel to carry fewer than the maximum for business and regulatory reasons.</p>
<p><strong>V201.1.2 Ferries.</strong>&nbsp; <em>Ferries</em> permitted to carry 100 or more passengers shall comply with Chapters 1 through 10.</p>
<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V201.1.2 Ferries.</strong>&nbsp; There are passenger vessels which are referred to as water taxis.&nbsp; If a water taxi meets the definition of a ferry in section V106.5 and is permitted to carry 100 or more passengers, the water taxi is subject to the requirements of this document.</p>
<p><strong>V201.1.3 Tenders.</strong>&nbsp; <em>Tenders</em> shall comply with Chapters 1 and 11.</p>
<p class="exception"><strong>Exception:</strong> <em>Tenders</em> permitted to carry less than 60 passengers shall not be required to comply with this document.</p>
<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V201.1.3 Tenders.</strong>&nbsp; Tenders (defined as a vessel primarily intended for transporting passengers for non-emergency purposes between passenger vessels and shore side facilities) that carry more than 150 passengers are only required to comply with chapters 1 and 11 and are not considered large vessels subject to V201.1.1.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>V201.2 Application Based on Facility Use.</strong>&nbsp; Where a <em>facility</em>, room, or <em>space</em> on a passenger vessel contains more than one use, each portion shall comply with the applicable requirements for that use.</p>
<p><strong>V201.3 Temporary and Permanent Structures.</strong>&nbsp; These requirements shall apply to temporary and permanent <em>facilities</em> on passenger vessels.</p>
<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V201.3 Temporary and Permanent Structures.</strong>&nbsp; Temporary facilities covered by these requirements include, but are not limited to, reviewing stands, bleacher areas, stages, platforms and daises, fixed furniture systems, wall systems, and exhibit areas.</p>
<p id="v202"><strong>V202 Existing Passenger Vessels</strong></p>
<p><strong>V202.1 General.</strong>&nbsp; <em>Additions</em> and <em>alterations</em> to existing passenger vessels shall comply with V202.</p>

<div class="exception">
<p><strong>Exceptions:&nbsp; 1.</strong>&nbsp; Unless required by V202.4, where <em>elements</em> or <em>spaces</em> are <em>altered</em> and the <em>circulation path</em> to the <em>altered element</em> or <em>space</em> is not <em>altered</em>, an onboard <em>accessible</em> route shall not be required.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp; In <em>alterations</em>, where compliance with applicable requirements is <em>technically infeasible</em>, the <em>alteration</em> shall comply with the requirements to the maximum extent feasible.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp; In <em>alterations</em>, each <em>alteration</em> shall provide <em>accessibility</em> to the maximum extent feasible where compliance with applicable provisions would result in:</p>
<ol>
<li>an increase in tonnage that changes the classification from 46 CFR subchapter K to 46 CFR subchapter H, or from 46 CFR subchapter T to 46 CFR subchapter H;</li>
<li>a violation of the minimum requirements established by the <em>administrative authority</em> for the stability of the vessel;</li>
<li>a reduction in the structural integrity or fire resistance of a Class A or B bulkhead (wall) or <em>deck</em> surface; or</li>
<li>an increase in power load in excess of the existing power supply.</li>
</ol></div>
<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V202.3 Alterations.</strong>&nbsp; Although covered entities are permitted to limit the scope of an alteration to individual elements, the alteration of multiple elements within a room or space may provide a cost-effective opportunity to make the entire room or space accessible.&nbsp; Any elements or spaces of the passenger vessel or facility that are required to comply with these requirements must be made accessible within the scope of the alteration, to the maximum extent feasible.&nbsp; If providing accessibility in compliance with these requirements for people with one type of disability (e.g., people who use wheelchairs) is not feasible, accessibility must still be provided in compliance with the requirements for people with other types of disabilities (e.g., people who have hearing impairments or who have vision impairments) to the extent that such accessibility is feasible.</p>
<p><strong>V202.3.1 Prohibited Reduction in Access.</strong>&nbsp; An <em>alteration</em> that decreases or has the effect of decreasing the <em>accessibility</em> of a passenger vessel below the requirements for new construction at the time of the <em>alteration</em> is prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>V202.3.2 Extent of Application.</strong>&nbsp; An <em>alteration</em> of an existing <em>element</em>, <em>space</em>, or area of a passenger vessel shall not impose a requirement for <em>accessibility</em> greater than required for new construction.</p>
<p><strong>V202.4 Alterations Affecting Primary Function Areas.</strong>&nbsp; In addition to the requirements of V202.3, an <em>alteration</em> that affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function shall be made so as to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the <em>altered</em> area, including the rest rooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the <em>altered</em> area, are readily <em>accessible</em> to and usable by individuals with disabilities, unless such <em>alteration</em>s are disproportionate to the overall <em>alterations</em> in terms of cost and scope as determined under criteria established by the Attorney General.</p>
<p><strong>V202.5 Alterations to Qualified Historic Passenger Vessels.</strong>&nbsp; <em>Alterations</em> to a <em>qualified historic passenger vessel</em> shall comply with V202.3 and V202.4.</p>
<p class="exception"><strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp; Where the State Historic Preservation Officer or Advisory Council on Historic Preservation determines that compliance with the requirements for onboard <em>accessible</em> routes or toilet <em>facilities</em> would threaten or destroy the historic significance of the passenger vessel, the exceptions for <em>alterations</em> to <em>qualified historic passenger vessels</em> for that <em>element</em> shall be permitted to apply.</p>
<p><strong>V203 General Exceptions</strong></p>
<p><strong>V203.1 General.</strong>&nbsp; Passenger vessels shall be exempt from these requirements to the extent specified by V203.</p>
<p><strong>V203.2 Employee Areas and Features.</strong>&nbsp; Areas and features of passenger vessels which are intended for use only by employees shall not be required to comply with this document.</p>

<p id="v302"><strong>V302 Deck Surfaces</strong></p>
<p><strong>V302.1 General.</strong>&nbsp; <em>Deck</em> surfaces shall be stable, firm, and slip resistant and shall comply with V302.</p>
<p><strong>Exceptions:</strong> <em>Areas of sport activity</em> shall not be required to comply with V302.</p>
<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V302.1 General.</strong>&nbsp; A stable surface is one that remains unchanged by contaminants or applied force, so that when the contaminant or force is removed, the surface returns to its original condition.&nbsp; A firm surface resists deformation by either indentations or particles moving on its surface.&nbsp; A slip-resistant surface provides sufficient frictional counterforce to the forces exerted in walking to permit safe ambulation.</p>
<p><strong>V302.2 Carpet.</strong>&nbsp; Carpet or carpet tile shall be securely attached and shall have a firm cushion, or backing or no cushion.&nbsp; Carpet or carpet tile shall have a level loop, textured loop, level cut pile, or level cut/uncut pile texture.&nbsp; Pile height shall be ½ inch (13 mm) maximum.&nbsp; Exposed edges of carpet shall be fastened to <em>deck</em> surfaces and shall have trim on the entire length of the exposed edge.&nbsp; Carpet edge trim shall comply with V303.</p>
<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V302.2 Carpet.</strong>&nbsp; Carpets and permanently affixed mats can significantly increase the amount of force (roll resistance) needed to propel a wheelchair over a surface.&nbsp; The firmer the carpeting and backing, the lower the roll resistance.&nbsp; A pile thickness up to ½ inch (13 mm) (measured to the backing, or cushion (e.g., padding) if no backing is provided) is allowed, although a lower pile provides easier wheelchair maneuvering.&nbsp; If a backing or cushion is used, it must be firm.&nbsp; Preferably, carpet cushion should not be used because the soft cushioning increases roll resistance.</p>
<p><strong>V302.3 Openings.</strong>&nbsp; Openings in <em>deck</em> surfaces shall not allow passage of a sphere more than ½ inch (13 mm) in diameter except as allowed in V407.4.3 and V409.4.&nbsp; Elongated openings shall be placed so that the long dimension is perpendicular to the dominant direction of travel.</p>
<p class="exception"><strong>Exceptions:&nbsp; 1.</strong>&nbsp; Vehicle tie-downs which are flush with the <em>deck</em> surface and are not located within an <em>accessible</em> route shall not be required to comply with V302.3.</p>
<p class="exception"><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp; Where the <em>administrative authority</em> determines that larger openings are needed for <em>deck</em> drainage, openings not located within an <em>accessible</em> route shall be permitted to be increased, if the size shall not allow passage of a sphere more than ¾ inch (19 mm) in diameter.</p>

<p class="exception"><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp; Where required by the <em>administrative authority</em> to meet weathertight door sealing requirements, weathertight doors shall be permitted to have non-beveled thresholds ¾ inch (19 mm) high maximum on the sealing side of the doors, if the thresholds contrast visually with adjacent <em>deck</em> surfaces either light-on-dark or dark-on-light.</p>
<div class="advisory">
<p class="first"><strong>Advisory V404.2.5 Thresholds and Coamings.</strong>&nbsp; Under US Coast Guard regulations and international treaties, certain weathertight doors are required to have raised thresholds (coamings) three or more inches in height that form a watertight barrier at the base of the door.&nbsp; These coamings help protect the stability of a vessel by reducing the amount of water that may enter the vessel through an open exterior door.&nbsp; Coamings also improve the survivability of a vessel.&nbsp; When a vessel has been damaged due to collision or other hazardous action, the coamings allow a portion of the doorway to be submerged without compromising the reserve buoyancy of the vessel.&nbsp; The draft guidelines set out three configurations of access at doors that are required to have coamings.</p>
<p>In the first configuration, the goal is to work with the applicable administrative authority to allow compliance with door maneuvering clearance (V404.2.4) and threshold (V404.2.5) requirements as specified without using the coaming exceptions.&nbsp; These clearances and threshold heights would be the same as any accessible door on land.&nbsp; However, V404.2.5 Exception 4 allows a maximum ¾ inch (19 mm) high non-beveled threshold at weathertight doors where such vertical surfaces are required by the administrative authority to meet door sealing requirements (see Figure V404.2.5).</p>
<p><strong>Advisory V404.2.5 Thresholds and Coamings Exceptions 1 through 4.</strong>&nbsp; Exceptions 1 through 3 permit the second configuration of access which allows readily removable coamings (where permitted by the administrative authority), or double and single ramp access methods.&nbsp; Exceptions in the maneuvering clearance provisions of V404.2.4 and V404.2.4.4 and ramp provisions of V405.2 and V405.7 permit modification of some requirements to allow installation of either the double or single ramp access methods.&nbsp; A double ramp access method (see Figure V404.2.5.2.1) has two ramps (maximum slope of 1:12) joining together at the top of a coaming (unless V404.2.5 Exception 4 applies), and the coaming equipped door is required to be automatic.&nbsp; In general, a single ramp access method (see Figure V404.2.5.2.2) has one ramp on only one side of the door connecting the top of the coaming (unless V404.2.5 Exception 4 applies), and a conforming door threshold on the other side.&nbsp; The ramp is allowed to have a maximum slope of 1:8 for a 3 inches (75 mm) maximum rise, or 1:10 for a 6 inches (150 mm) maximum rise.</p>
<p>V404.2.5 Exception 4 allows a maximum ¾ inch (19 mm) high non-beveled vertical surface on the sealing side (typically, exterior side) of weathertight doors where such vertical surfaces are required by the administrative authority to meet door sealing requirements (see Figure V404.2.5.2.2).&nbsp; Although this vertical surface is permitted to be located at the top of the ramps used in the double and single ramp access methods, it is recommended that alternatives be explored with the administrative authority before using this exception in conjunction with either the double or single ramp access methods.&nbsp; Alternatives may consist of drainage systems which collect leakage where doors seal against ramp surfaces.</p>
<p class="last">Where it is not feasible to comply with the second configuration of access, an exception in V404.2.5.2 allows the third configuration of access to be used.&nbsp; The third configuration consists of watertight doors with 1¼ inches (32 mm) high non-beveled thresholds on only one side of the doors.</p>

<p id="v706"><strong>V706 Assistive Listening Systems</strong></p>
<p><strong>V706.1 General.</strong>&nbsp; <em>Assistive listening systems</em> shall comply with V706.</p>
<div class="advisory">
<p class="first"><strong>Advisory V706.1 General.</strong>&nbsp; Assistive listening systems are generally categorized by their mode of transmission.&nbsp; There are hard-wired systems and three types of wireless systems: induction loop, infrared, and FM radio transmission.&nbsp; Each has different advantages and disadvantages that can help determine which system is best for a given application.&nbsp; For example, an FM system may be better than an infrared system in some open-air assemblies since infrared signals are less effective in sunlight.&nbsp; On the other hand, an infrared system is typically a better choice than an FM system where confidential transmission is important because it will be contained within a given space.&nbsp; Induction loop systems, however, enable persons who use hearing aids (or cochlear implants) equipped with telecoils to use the system without needing a separate receiver and headset.</p>
<p>The technical standards for assistive listening systems describe minimum performance levels for volume, interference, and distortion.&nbsp; Sound pressure levels (SPL), expressed in decibels, measure output sound volume.&nbsp; Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR or S/N), also expressed in decibels, represents the relationship between the loudness of a desired sound (the signal) and the background noise in a space or piece of equipment.&nbsp; The higher the SNR, the more intelligible the signal.&nbsp; The peak clipping level limits the distortion in signal output produced when high-volume sound waves are manipulated to serve assistive listening devices.</p>
<p class="last">Selecting or specifying an effective assistive listening system for a large or complex venue requires assistance from a professional sound engineer who is knowledgeable about assistive technology and the communication needs of people with hearing loss.&nbsp; The Access Board has published technical assistance on assistive listening devices and systems (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130721165154/http://www.access-board.gov/">www.access-board.gov</a>).</p>
</div>
<p><strong>V706.2 Receiver Jacks.</strong>&nbsp; Receivers required for use with an <em>assistive listening system</em> shall include a 1/8 inch (3.2 mm) standard mono jack.</p>
<p><strong>V706.3 Receiver Hearing-Aid Compatibility.</strong>&nbsp; Receivers required to be hearing-aid compatible shall interface with telecoils in hearing aids through the provision of neckloops.</p>
<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V706.3 Receiver Hearing-Aid Compatibility.</strong>&nbsp; The telecoil is a circuit installed inside many hearing aids (and cochlear implants).&nbsp; When the hearing aid is set to the telecoil mode, the hearing aid can pick up the electromagnetic energy emitted from the neckloop which is connected to an infrared or FM receiver.&nbsp; Receivers that are not compatible with hearing aids include those connected to earbuds (which may require removal of hearing aids), and earphones and headsets that must be worn over the ear which can create disruptive interference in the transmission and can be uncomfortable for people wearing hearing aids.&nbsp; Some headsets can function as neckloops.&nbsp; An exception is provided in V219.3 regarding the requirement of V706.3 where induction loop systems are installed.</p>
<p><strong>V706.4 Sound Pressure Level.</strong>&nbsp; <em>Assistive listening systems</em> shall be capable of providing a sound pressure level of 110 dB minimum and 118 dB maximum with a dynamic range on the volume control of 50 dB.</p>
<p><strong>V706.5 Signal-to-Noise Ratio.</strong>&nbsp; The signal-to-noise ratio for internally generated noise in <em>assistive listening systems</em> shall be 18 dB minimum.</p>
<p><strong>V706.6 Peak Clipping Level.</strong>&nbsp; Peak clipping shall not exceed 18 dB of clipping relative to the peaks of speech.</p>

<p><strong>V707.1 General.</strong>&nbsp; Automatic teller machines and fare machines shall comply with V707.</p>
<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V707.1 General.</strong>&nbsp; If farecards have one tactually distinctive corner they can be inserted with greater accuracy.&nbsp; Token collection devices that are designed to accommodate tokens which are perforated can allow a person to distinguish more readily between tokens and common coins.&nbsp; Place accessible gates and fare vending machines in close proximity to other accessible elements when feasible so the facility is easier to use.</p>
<p><strong>V707.2 Clear Deck Space.</strong>&nbsp; A clear <em>deck space</em> complying with V305 shall be provided.</p>

<p><strong>V707.4 Privacy.</strong>&nbsp; Automatic teller machines shall provide the opportunity for the same degree of privacy of input and output available to all individuals.</p>
<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V707.4 Privacy.</strong>&nbsp; In addition to people who are blind or visually impaired, people with limited reach who use wheelchairs or have short stature, who cannot effectively block the ATM screen with their bodies, may prefer to use speech output.&nbsp; Speech output users can benefit from an option to render the visible screen blank, thereby affording them greater personal security and privacy.</p>
<p><strong>V707.5 Speech Output.</strong>&nbsp; Machines shall be speech enabled.&nbsp; Operating instructions and orientation, visible transaction prompts, user input verification, error messages, and all displayed information for full use shall be <em>accessible</em> to and independently usable by individuals with vision impairments.&nbsp; Speech shall be delivered through a mechanism that is readily available to all users, including but not limited to, an industry standard connector or a telephone handset.&nbsp; Speech shall be recorded or digitized human, or synthesized.</p>
<p class="exception"><strong>Exceptions:&nbsp; 1.</strong>&nbsp; Audible tones shall be permitted instead of speech for visible output that is not displayed for security purposes, including but not limited to, asterisks representing personal identification numbers.</p>
<p class="exception"><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp; Advertisements and other similar information shall not be required to be audible unless they convey information that can be used in the transaction being conducted.</p>
<p class="exception"><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp; Where speech synthesis cannot be supported, dynamic alphabetic output shall not be required to be audible.</p>
<p class="advisory"><strong>Advisory V707.5 Speech Output.</strong>&nbsp; If an ATM provides additional functions such as dispensing coupons, selling theater tickets, or providing copies of monthly statements, all such functions must be available to customers using speech output.&nbsp; To avoid confusion at the ATM, the method of initiating the speech mode should be easily discoverable and should not require specialized training.&nbsp; For example, if a telephone handset is provided, lifting the handset can initiate the speech mode.</p>
