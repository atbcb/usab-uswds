            <h3 id="ada-101_1">101.1 General</h3>
            <p class="standards">This document contains scoping and technical requirements for accessibility to sites, facilities, buildings, and elements by individuals with disabilities.  The requirements are to be applied during the design, construction, additions to, and alteration of sites, facilities, buildings, and elements to the extent required by regulations issued by Federal agencies under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).</p>
            <p class="advisory">Advisory 101.1 General.  In addition to these requirements, covered entities must comply with the regulations issued by the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation under the Americans with Disabilities Act.  There are issues affecting individuals with disabilities which are not addressed by these requirements, but which are covered by the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation regulations.</p>
            
            <h3 id="ada-101_2">101.2 Effect on Removal of Barriers in Existing Facilities</h3>
            <p class="standards">This document does not address existing facilities unless altered at the discretion of a covered entity.  The Department of Justice has authority over existing facilities that are subject to the requirement for removal of barriers under title III of the ADA.  Any determination that this document applies to existing facilities subject to the barrier removal requirement is solely within the discretion of the Department of Justice and is effective only to the extent required by regulations issued by the Department of Justice.</p>
                                        
            <h2 id="ada-102">102 Dimensions for Adults and Children</h2>
            <p class="standards">The technical requirements are based on adult dimensions and anthropometrics.  In addition, this document includes technical requirements based on children’s dimensions and anthropometrics for drinking fountains, water closets, toilet compartments, lavatories and sinks, dining surfaces, and work surfaces.</p>
            <h2 id="ada-103">103 Equivalent Facilitation</h2>
            <p class="standards">Nothing in these requirements prevents the use of designs, products, or technologies as alternatives to those prescribed, provided they result in substantially equivalent or greater accessibility and usability.</p>
            <p class="advisory">Advisory 103 Equivalent Facilitation.  The responsibility for demonstrating equivalent facilitation in the event of a challenge rests with the covered entity.  With the exception of transit facilities, which are covered by regulations issued by the Department of Transportation, there is no process for certifying that an alternative design provides equivalent facilitation.</p>

            <p class="standards">Dimensions that are not stated as “maximum” or “minimum” are absolute.</p>
            
            <h4 id="ada-104_1_1">104.1.1 Construction and Manufacturing Tolerances</h4>
            <p class="standards"> All dimensions are subject to conventional industry tolerances except where the requirement is stated as a range with specific minimum and maximum end points.</p>
            <div id="ada-104_1_1_advisory" class="advisory">
            <p class="first">Advisory 104.1.1 Construction and Manufacturing Tolerances.  Conventional industry tolerances recognized by this provision include those for field conditions and those that may be a necessary consequence of a particular manufacturing process. Recognized tolerances are not intended to apply to design work.</p>
            <p>It is good practice when specifying dimensions to avoid specifying a tolerance where dimensions are absolute.  For example, if this document requires “1 inches,” avoid specifying “1 inches plus or minus X inches.”</p>
            <p>Where the requirement states a specified range, such as in Section <a href="#ada-609_4" class="navSectionLink">609.4</a> where grab bars must be installed between 33 inches and 36 inches above the floor, the range provides an adequate tolerance and therefore no tolerance outside of the range at either end point is permitted.</p>
            <p>Where a requirement is a minimum or a maximum dimension that does not have two specific minimum and maximum end points, tolerances may apply.  Where an element is to be installed at the minimum or maximum permitted dimension, such as “15 inches minimum” or “5 pounds maximum”, it would not be good practice to specify “5 pounds (plus X pounds) or 15 inches (minus X inches).”  Rather, it would be good practice to specify a dimension less than the required maximum (or more than the required minimum) by the amount of the expected field or manufacturing tolerance and not to state any tolerance in conjunction with the specified dimension.</p>
            <p class="last">Specifying dimensions in design in the manner described above will better ensure that facilities and elements accomplish the level of accessibility intended by these requirements.  It will also more often produce an end result of strict and literal compliance with the stated requirements and eliminate enforcement difficulties and issues that might otherwise arise.  Information on specific tolerances may be available from industry or trade organizations, code groups and building officials, and published references.</p>

            <div class="advisory">
            <p class="first">Advisory 105.2.2 ASME.  ASME A17.1-2000 is used by local jurisdictions throughout the United States for the design, construction, installation, operation, inspection, testing, maintenance, alteration, and repair of elevators and escalators.  The majority of the requirements apply to the operational machinery not seen or used by elevator passengers.  ASME A17.1 requires a two-way means of emergency communications in passenger elevators.  This means of communication must connect with emergency or authorized personnel and not an automated answering system.  The communication system must be push button activated.  The activation button must be permanently identified with the word “HELP.”  A visual indication acknowledging the establishment of a communications link to authorized personnel must be provided.  The visual indication must remain on until the call is terminated by authorized personnel.  The building location, the elevator car number, and the need for assistance must be provided to authorized personnel answering the emergency call.  The use of a handset by the communications system is prohibited.  Only the authorized personnel answering the call can terminate the call.  Operating instructions for the communications system must be provided in the elevator car.</p>
            <p>The provisions for escalators require that at least two flat steps be provided at the entrance and exit of every escalator and that steps on escalators be demarcated by yellow lines 2 inches wide maximum along the back and sides of steps.</p>
            <p>ASME A18.1-1999 and ASME A18.1-2003 address the design, construction, installation, operation, inspection, testing, maintenance and repair of lifts that are intended for transportation of persons with disabilities.  Lifts are classified as: vertical platform lifts, inclined platform lifts, inclined stairway chairlifts, private residence vertical platform lifts, private residence inclined platform lifts, and private residence inclined stairway chairlifts.</p>
            <p>This document does not permit the use of inclined stairway chairlifts which do not provide platforms because such lifts require the user to transfer to a seat.</p>
            <p>ASME A18.1 contains requirements for runways, which are the spaces in which platforms or seats move.  The standard includes additional provisions for runway enclosures, electrical equipment and wiring, structural support, headroom clearance (which is 80 inches minimum), lower level access ramps and pits.  The enclosure walls not used for entry or exit are required to have a grab bar the full length of the wall on platform lifts.  Access ramps are required to meet requirements similar to those for ramps in Chapter 4 of this document.</p>
            <p class="last">Each of the lift types addressed in ASME A18.1 must meet requirements for capacity, load, speed, travel, operating devices, and control equipment.  The maximum permitted height for operable parts is consistent with Section <a href="#ada-308" class="navSectionLink">308</a> of this document.  The standard also addresses attendant operation.  However, Section <a href="#ada-410_1" class="navSectionLink">410.1</a> of this document does not permit attendant operation.</p>

ASTM F 1292-99 and ASTM F 1292-04 establish a uniform means to measure and compare characteristics of surfacing materials to determine whether materials provide a safe surface under and around playground equipment.  These standards are referenced in the play areas requirements of this document when an accessible surface is required inside a play area use zone where a fall attenuating surface is also required.  The standards cover the minimum impact attenuation requirements, when tested in accordance with Test Method F 355, for surface systems to be used under and around any piece of playground equipment from which a person may fall.</p>
            <p class="standards">ASTM F 1487-01 establishes a nationally recognized safety standard for public playground equipment to address injuries identified by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.  It defines the use zone, which is the ground area beneath and immediately adjacent to a play structure or play equipment designed for unrestricted circulation around the equipment and on whose surface it is predicted that a user would land when falling from or exiting a play structure or equipment.  The play areas requirements in this document reference the ASTM F 1487 standard when defining accessible routes that overlap use zones requiring fall attenuating surfaces.  If the use zone of a playground is not entirely surfaced with an accessible material, at least one accessible route within the use zone must be provided from the perimeter to all accessible play structures or components within the playground.</p>
            <p class="last">ASTM F 1951-99 establishes a uniform means to measure the characteristics of surface systems in order to provide performance specifications to select materials for use as an accessible surface under and around playground equipment.  Surface materials that comply with this standard and are located in the use zone must also comply with ASTM F 1292.  The test methods in this standard address access for children and adults who may traverse the surfacing to aid children who are playing.  When a surface is tested it must have an average work per foot value for straight propulsion and for turning less than the average work per foot values for straight propulsion and for turning, respectively, on a hard, smooth surface with a grade of 7% (1:14).</p>

                <div class="advisory">
                <p class="first">Advisory 202.5 Alterations to Qualified Historic Buildings and Facilities Exception.  State Historic Preservation Officers are State appointed officials who carry out certain responsibilities under the National Historic Preservation Act.  State Historic Preservation Officers consult with Federal and State agencies, local governments, and private entities on providing access and protecting significant elements of qualified historic buildings and facilities. There are exceptions for alterations to qualified historic buildings and facilities for accessible routes (206.2.1 Exception 1 and <a href="#ada-206_2_3" class="navSectionLink">206.2.3</a> Exception 7); entrances (206.4 Exception 2); and toilet facilities (213.2 Exception 2).  When an entity believes that compliance with the requirements for any of these elements would threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or facility, the entity should consult with the State Historic Preservation Officer.  If the State Historic Preservation Officer agrees that compliance with the requirements for a specific element would threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or facility, use of the exception is permitted.  Public entities have an additional obligation to achieve program accessibility under the Department of Justice ADA regulations.  See 28 CFR 35.150.  These regulations require public entities that operate historic preservation programs to give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with disabilities.  If alterations to a qualified historic building or facility to achieve program accessibility would threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or facility, fundamentally alter the program, or result in undue financial or administrative burdens, the Department of Justice ADA regulations allow alternative methods to be used to achieve program accessibility.  In the case of historic preservation programs, such as an historic house museum, alternative methods include using audio-visual materials to depict portions of the house that cannot otherwise be made accessible.  In the case of other qualified historic properties, such as an historic government office building, alternative methods include relocating programs and services to accessible locations.  The Department of Justice ADA regulations also allow public entities to use alternative methods when altering qualified historic buildings or facilities in the rare situations where the State Historic Preservation Officer determines that it is not feasible to provide physical access using the exceptions permitted in Section <a href="#ada-202_5" class="navSectionLink">202.5</a> without threatening or destroying the historic significance of the building or facility.

                <p class="advisory">Advisory 224.1 General.  Certain facilities used for transient lodging, including time shares, dormitories, and town homes may be covered by both these requirements and the Fair Housing Amendments Act.  The Fair Housing Amendments Act requires that certain residential structures having four or more multi-family dwelling units, regardless of whether they are privately owned or federally assisted, include certain features of accessible and adaptable design according to guidelines established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  This law and the appropriate regulations should be consulted before proceeding with the design and construction of residential housing.</p>

                <p class="advisory">Advisory 224.1.1 Alterations.  In alterations and additions, the minimum required number of accessible guest rooms is based on the total number of guest rooms altered or added instead of the total number of guest rooms provided in a facility.

When accessible guest rooms are added as a result of subsequent alterations, compliance with <a href="#ada-224_5" class="navSectionLink">224.5</a> (Dispersion) is more likely to be achieved if all of the accessible guest rooms are not provided in the same area of the facility.</p>

                <p class="advisory">Advisory 235.2 Boat Slips.  The requirement for boat slips also applies to piers where boat slips are not demarcated.  For example, a single pier 25 feet (7620 mm) long and 5 feet (1525 mm) wide (the minimum width specified by Section 1003.3) allows boats to moor on three sides.  Because the number of boat slips is not demarcated, the total length of boat slip edge (55 feet, 17 m) must be used to determine the number of boat slips provided (two).  This number is based on the specification in Section <a href="#ada-235_2" class="navSectionLink">235.2</a> that each 40 feet (12 m) of boat slip edge, or fraction thereof, counts as one boat slip.  In this example, Table 235.2 would require one boat slip to be accessible.</p>

Types of boat slips are based on the size of the boat slips; whether single berths or double berths, shallow water or deep water, transient or longer-term lease, covered or uncovered; and whether slips are equipped with features such as telephone, water, electricity or cable connections.  The term “boat slip” is intended to cover any pier area other than launch ramp boarding piers where recreational boats are moored for purposes of berthing, embarking, or disembarking.  For example, a fuel pier may contain boat slips, and this type of short term slip would be included in determining compliance with 235.2.</p>

<p class="advisory">Advisory 502.3.3 Marking.  The method and color of marking are not specified by these requirements but may be addressed by State or local laws or regulations.  Because these requirements permit the van access aisle to be as wide as a parking space, it is important that the aisle be clearly marked.</p>

<p class="advisory">Advisory 502.3.4 Location.  Wheelchair lifts typically are installed on the passenger side of vans.  Many drivers, especially those who operate vans, find it more difficult to back into parking spaces than to back out into comparatively unrestricted vehicular lanes.  For this reason, where a van and car share an access aisle, consider locating the van space so that the access aisle is on the passenger side of the van space.</p>

<p class="advisory">Advisory 505.4 Height.  The requirements for stair and ramp handrails in this document are for adults.  When children are the principal users in a building or facility (e.g., elementary schools), a second set of handrails at an appropriate height can assist them and aid in preventing accidents.  A maximum height of 28 inches (710 mm) measured to the top of the gripping surface from the ramp surface or stair nosing is recommended for handrails designed for children.  Sufficient vertical clearance between upper and lower handrails, 9 inches (230 mm) minimum, should be provided to help prevent entrapment.</p>

<p class="standards">Assistive listening systems required in assembly areas shall comply with <a href="#ada-706" class="navSectionLink">706</a>.</p>
<div class="advisory">
<p class="first">Advisory 706.1 General.  Assistive listening systems are generally categorized by their mode of transmission.  There are hard-wired systems and three types of wireless systems: induction loop, infrared, and FM radio transmission.  Each has different advantages and disadvantages that can help determine which system is best for a given application.  For example, an FM system may be better than an infrared system in some open-air assemblies since infrared signals are less effective in sunlight.  On the other hand, an infrared system is typically a better choice than an FM system where confidential transmission is important because it will be contained within a given space.</p>
<p class="standards">The technical standards for assistive listening systems describe minimum performance levels for volume, interference, and distortion.  Sound pressure levels (SPL), expressed in decibels, measure output sound volume.  Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR or S/N), also expressed in decibels, represents the relationship between the loudness of a desired sound (the signal) and the background noise in a space or piece of equipment.  The higher the SNR, the more intelligible the signal.  The peak clipping level limits the distortion in signal output produced when high-volume sound waves are manipulated to serve assistive listening devices.</p>
<p class="last">Selecting or specifying an effective assistive listening system for a large or complex venue requires assistance from a professional sound engineer.  The Access Board has published technical assistance on assistive listening devices and systems.</p>

<p class="advisory">Advisory 810.6 Rail Station Signs Exception.  Emerging technologies such as an audible sign systems using infrared transmitters and receivers may provide greater accessibility in the transit environment than traditional Braille and raised letter signs.  The transmitters are placed on or next to print signs and transmit their information to an infrared receiver that is held by a person.  By scanning an area, the person will hear the sign.  This means that signs can be placed well out of reach of Braille readers, even on parapet walls and on walls beyond barriers.  Additionally, such signs can be used to provide wayfinding information that cannot be efficiently conveyed on Braille signs.</p>
