**SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:**

On February 14, 2020, the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) issued an [advance notice of proposed rulemaking](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/transportation/vehicles/update-of-the-guidelines-for-transportation-vehicles/advance-notice-of-proposed-rulemaking) to begin the process of updating its existing accessibility guidelines for rail vehicles covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act. See 85 FR 8516, February 14, 2020. In that notice, the Access Board requested comments by May 14, 2020.

On March 26, 2020, the American Public Transit Association (APTA) requested that the 90-day comment period be extended for an additional 60 days to allow for a more thorough, careful review of the 25 technical questions posed by the Board. APTA continued that "given the pandemic and national emergency declarations, our members who are concerned about this issue have been pulled away to work on essential functions. Thus, the additional time would allow APTA members to collaborate and develop thoughtful responses to the Access Board's questions."

Although the Access Board has already provided a 90-day comment period and held a public hearing on the ANPRM, the Board will provide additional time for the public to submit comments.
