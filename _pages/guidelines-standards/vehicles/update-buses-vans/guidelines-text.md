#### T102 Conventions

T102.1 Calculation of Percentages. Where the determination of the required size or dimension of an element involves ratios or percentages, rounding down for values less than one half shall be permitted.

T102.2 Units of Measurement. Measurements are stated in U.S. and metric customary units. The values stated in each system (U.S. and metric customary units) may not be exact equivalents, and each system shall be used independently of the other.

T102.3 Vehicle Length. The length of non-rail vehicles shall be measured from standard bumper to standard bumper.

#### T103 Definitions

T103.1 Terms Defined in Referenced Standards. Terms defined in referenced standards and not defined in T103.4 shall have the meaning as defined in the referenced standards.

T103.2 Undefined Terms. Terms not specifically defined in T103.4 or in regulations issued by the Department of Transportation (49 CFR part 37) shall be given their ordinarily accepted meaning in the sense that the context implies.

T103.3 Interchangeability. Words, terms, and phrases used in the singular include the plural; and words, terms, and phrases used in the plural include the singular.

T103.4 Defined Terms. For the purpose of the Non-Rail Vehicle Guidelines, the following terms have the indicated meaning.

*Boarding platform*. A platform in a level boarding bus system raised above standard curb height in order to align vertically with the transit vehicle entry for level boarding and alighting.

*Fixed route service (or fixed route).* Operation of a non-rail vehicle along a prescribed route according to a fixed schedule.

*Large transit entity.* A provider of public transportation that is required to report to the National Transportation Database (49 U.S.C. 5335), and that, for an any given calendar year, reports to such database the operation of 100 or more buses in annual maximum service for all fixed-route service bus modes collectively, through either direct operation or purchased transportation.

*Large non-rail vehicle*. Non-rail vehicles that are more than 25 feet (7.6 m) in length.

*Level boarding bus system.* A system in which buses operate where some or all of the designated stops have boarding platforms and the design of boarding platforms and non-rail vehicles are coordinated to provide boarding having little or no change in level between the vehicle floor and the boarding platform.

*Non-rail vehicle.* A self-propelled, rubber-tired vehicle used to provide transportation services and intended for use on city streets, highways, or busways that constitutes either a bus, over-the-road bus, or van.

*Operable part.* A component of a device or system used to insert or withdraw objects, or to activate, deactivate, adjust, or connect to the device or system. Operable parts include, but are not limited to, buttons, levers, knobs, smart card targets, coin and card slots, pull-cords, jacks, data ports, electrical outlets, and touchscreens.

*Small non-rail vehicle.* Non-rail vehicles that are equal to or less than 25 feet (7.6 m) in length.
