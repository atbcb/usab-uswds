**Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines for Transportation Vehicles**

**AGENCY:**  Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board.

**ACTION:**  Final rule.

**SUMMARY:**  The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board or Board) is issuing a final rule that revises its existing accessibility guidelines for non-rail vehicles -- namely, buses, over-the-road buses, and vans -- acquired or remanufactured by entities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act.  The revised guidelines ensure that such vehicles are readily accessible to, and usable by, individuals with disabilities.  The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is required to revise its accessibility standards for transportation vehicles acquired or remanufactured by entities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to be consistent with the final rule.

**DATES:**  The final rule is effective January 13, 2017.  Compliance with the final rule is not required until DOT revises its accessibility standards for buses, over-the-road buses, and vans acquired or remanufactured by entities covered by the ADA to be consistent with the final rule.

The incorporation by reference of one publication listed in the final rule was approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of January 13, 2017.
