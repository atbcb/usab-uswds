### Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines for Transportation Vehicles

**AGENCY:** Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board.

**ACTION:** Availability of draft revisions to guidelines.

**SUMMARY:** The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) has placed in the docket and on its web site for public review and comment draft revisions to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines for Transportation Vehicles. The draft revisions to the guidelines cover only buses, vans and similar vehicles. Draft revisions to the guidelines for other modes will be issued later. Comments will be accepted on the draft revisions to the guidelines, and the Access Board will consider those comments prior to issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking to update the guidelines.

**DATES:** Comments on the draft revisions to the guidelines must be received by June 11, 2007.

**ADDRESSES:** Comments should be sent to Docket 2007-1, Office of Technical and Informational Services, Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, 1331 F Street NW, suite 1000, Washington, DC 20004-1111. E-mail comments should be sent to <cannon@access-board.gov>. Comments sent by e-mail will be considered only if they contain the full name and address of the sender in the text. Comments will be available for inspection at the above address from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on regular business days.

**FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:** Dennis Cannon, Office of Technical and Information Services, Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, 1331 F Street, NW, suite 1000, Washington DC 20004-1111. Telephone number: (202) 272-0015 (voice); (202) 272-0082 (TTY). Electronic mail address: <cannon@access-board.gov>.

**SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:** In 1991, the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) issued the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines for Transportation Vehicles, which is codified at 36 CFR part 1192. The guidelines have not been updated since they were issued, except for modifications for over-the-road buses in 1994. The Access Board is beginning the process of updating the guidelines by publishing draft revisions to subparts A and B of 36 CFR part 1192, which contain general provisions and cover buses, vans and similar vehicles. Draft revisions to other subparts, which cover other modes, will be available later. Changes are proposed to accommodate new technology and vehicles, and new system designs, particularly Bus Rapid Transit.

Subsequent to issuance of the guidelines in 1991, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued regulations for vehicle lifts. The Access Board will coordinate its rulemaking with NHTSA to ensure consistency.

The Access Board is making the draft revisions to the guidelines and supplemental information available for public review and comment prior to issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking to update the guidelines. Comments on the draft revisions to the guidelines will be considered by the Access Board in developing the notice of proposed rulemaking to update the guidelines, which will also be open for public comment. The draft revisions to the guidelines and supplementary information are available on the Access Board's Internet site (http://www.access-board.gov/vguidedraft.htm). You may also obtain a copy of the draft guidelines and supplementary information by contacting the Access Board at (202) 272-0080. Persons using a TTY should call (202) 272-0082. The documents are available in alternate formats upon request. Persons who want a copy in an alternate format should specify the type of format (cassette tape, Braille, large print, or ASCII disk).

### Discussion of Revisions

**April 11, 2007**

### Discussion of Revisions

In 1991, the U. S. Access Board issued Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Transportation Vehicles, codified at 36 CFR Part 1192. These guidelines form the basis for enforceable standards issued by the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT), codified at 49 CFR Part 38. Except for supplemental provisions for over-the-road buses issued in 1994, the guidelines have not been changed. Since the guidelines were first issued, new technology, vehicles and services have been introduced into public transportation. In 2006, the Board decided to update and refresh the vehicle guidelines.

The guidelines are divided into eight subparts. Subpart A includes general provisions pertaining to all vehicles covered by the DOT regulation (49 CFR Part 37), subparts B through G cover vehicles for various modes, and subpart H covers all other vehicle and service types. The Board plans to update the provisions subpart by subpart, beginning with Subpart B Buses, Vans and Systems, along with some correlated modifications to Subpart A. The first step is publication of this draft and request for comment. Comments on the draft received during the 60-day comment period will be considered in creating a subsequent Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), which will be open for additional comment. A final rule will be issued after comments to the NPRM are analyzed. The updated guidelines will apply to buses, vans and similar vehicles procured or modified after an effective date to be established by DOT when it issues standards based on the final guidelines.

Subpart A contains definitions for all the modes, but, for purposes of this draft, only those definitions pertaining to buses, vans and similar vehicles are included for reference. Most of them are not being recommended for change. A new definition of "bridgeplate" has been added. These devices are common for rail vehicles, but are new to buses because of Bus Rapid Transit. The definition of "common wheelchair" has been removed because it was misunderstood and misused. First, definitions are not regulatory. They are provided to help affected parties understand the requirements which are contained in the regulatory text. Second, the Access Board has no authority to regulate wheelchairs or mobility aids. Nevertheless, some transit agencies were using the definition to exclude certain wheelchairs from receiving service, even when those wheelchairs could be accommodated within the vehicle. The Board's guidelines only apply to vehicles, so a new paragraph (c) is being proposed in 1192.21 to clarify the minimum width, length and height envelope which must be available within the vehicle, for it to be deemed accessible. The three-dimensional space must be available from the entrance to securement locations. A manufacturer or transit provider is not required to design or modify a vehicle to provide additional space to accommodate a wheelchair or mobility aid which is larger or weighs more than the lift, ramp or bridgeplate design load. Whether a provider must transport a wheelchair which exceeds those limits, but can still fit within the vehicle, is a matter for DOT to decide. The Board specifically requests comments on how to make the language of this section clearer.

A new paragraph (d) in section 1192.21 is intended to provide guidance to designers of Bus Rapid Transit projects which are often designed and executed as a system involving both vehicles and stop improvements. Since these guidelines are for vehicles, this paragraph is included here only to facilitate review and comment. When the Board issues its NPRM proposing changes to the vehicle guidelines, a provision similar to paragraph (d) may be proposed as an amendment to the ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities. Alternatively, DOT may add this section to its regulations in 49 CFR Part 37.

Paragraph (a) in section 1192.23 on mobility aid accessibility has been reordered and renumbered. The existing guidelines contain only a general performance requirement for maneuvering clearance. Performance requirements are intended to give design flexibility, but, in practice, this section has lead to disputes between manufacturers and transit agencies on whether a particular design complies. The revised section attempts to add more specificity by requiring a route from the entrance to securement locations with a minimum 36 inch width. This is consistent with accessible routes in buildings, but has not previously been applied to vehicles. The Board recognizes that vehicles are constrained by road lane width and some restrictions in tunnels and bridges. The Board requests comments on the feasibility of this requirement. If a 36 inch width is not possible, would a 32 inch minimum width be achievable? In addition, front door entry necessitates a right angle turn. The available space is constrained by the fare box, driver seat, modesty panels and wheel wells. A 5-foot turning circle is not possible. In building standards, a 42-inch minimum aisle is required to turn into a 36-inch wide aisle. Can this be achieved in a bus? How can the maneuvering and turning space be defined so that compliance is more verifiable?

A problem frequently raised is accommodation of larger and heavier wheelchairs. Some size increases may not be achievable because of external constraints on vehicles which are beyond the control of the guidelines. Others could be solved with rear door entry. The Board is not inclined to mandate either front or rear door entry because of environmental barriers at bus stops. The draft does attempt to partially address the weight issue by specifying a higher design load for lifts, ramps and bridgeplates.

Lift manufacturers have told the Board that some jurisdictions specify a higher weight for lifts (e.g., 720 lbs). On the other hand, a review of available ramp specifications indicates 660 lbs is the weight limit. Even though lifts may be designed for more, most transit agencies intersperse ramp and lift buses. If lifts and ramps had different requirements, a passenger might make a trip on a lift-equipped bus and then discover he or she could not get home because a ramp bus arrived for the return trip. Therefore, the draft proposes raising the design to 660 lbs, from the current 600 lb requirement. Another factor to be considered is that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has issued standards prescribing a whole series of tests based on the 600 lb requirement, in particular, the outer barrier test. What are the safety implications for a 700 lb wheelchair, for example, if the barrier is only designed to contain 600 lbs? The Board intends to coordinate its rulemaking with NHTSA.

Requirements for ramps have been simplified in paragraph (c) of section 1192.23. Instead of the complicated and confusing slopes tied to floor height, the proposal is to set the maximum slope at 1:8 in all cases, including when deployed to the roadway. This is possible now because of new ramp designs not available when the current guidelines were issued. In addition, in paragraph (c)(5) the draft requires only one door intended for boarding wheelchairs to meet this requirement if it can be accessed from all required securement locations. Other doors can have short bridgeplates. This is primarily intended to accommodate Bus Rapid Transit systems which have multiple doors boarding from platforms at vehicle floor height. A new provision has also been added in paragraph (c)(9) to require power operated ramps and bridgeplates to be deployable manually.

The securement design load provisions are unchanged. There has been considerable discussion over the years as to the adequacy or necessity of the force requirements. Currently, the requirement is primarily performance oriented. It does not specify a "four-point tiedown" although this has become the general norm. There has also been confusion about the purpose of securement devices. The securement system is not intended as passenger restraint or for protection of the wheelchair user. It is intended to duplicate, to the extent possible, the requirement on all other bus seats that they remain affixed to the vehicle in the event of a crash. The seat belt and shoulder harness, the use of which is at the option of the passenger, are provided primarily for persons with limited upper body strength who want additional stability. DOT has ruled that seat belt and shoulder harness use cannot be required unless all passengers are required to use them. In addition, DOT permits transit operators to establish a policy not to require securement. Nevertheless, a vehicle must have securement devices, seat belts and shoulder harnesses to be considered accessible. Seat belts and shoulder harnesses are currently required to comply with applicable provisions of 49 CFR 571. The Board seeks comment on whether the Society of Automotive Engineers standard would be better (<http://www.sae.org/technical/standards/ground_vehicle/ACTIV>).

Securement location and size requirements have been revised to require additional space where the area is constrained on three sides by seats, modesty panels, wheel wells, etc. The provisions are taken from requirements for alcoves in the new ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities. Two figures from that document will be included. A current provision allowing some of the required floor space to be under seats and panels has been removed. That provision worked for wheelchair footrests, but could not accommodate many scooters which have a front tiller control.

The provision for wheelchairs to be accommodated has been changed to remove the reference to common wheelchairs. Instead it would refer to the special requirements in 1192.21(c). The DOT regulation at 49 CFR 37.165(f) requires transit personnel to assist passengers with boarding, alighting and securement use. The stowage provision has been clarified so that the securement device cannot protrude into the required clear floor area. Also, the size of the padded barrier behind a rear-facing securement location has been refined.

The failure of bus drivers to call out stops as required by the DOT rule has been identified as a significant problem. Therefore, the draft proposes to require an automated system. In addition, a visual display is required to provide the same or equivalent information to people who cannot hear the auditory announcements..

Other changes clarify the vertical clearance required from the vehicle entrance to securement locations, eliminates the requirement for an overhead handrail in favor of seat-back handholds, deletes a specific placement for exterior lights, and incorporates signage specifications from the ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities.

(b) If portions of a vehicle are modified in a way that affects or could affect accessibility, each such portion shall comply, to the maximum extent feasible, with the applicable provisions of this subpart. This provision does not require that inaccessible buses be retrofitted with lifts, ramps or other boarding devices.

(c) Vehicles shall provide an unobstructed volume, from the level change or boarding device to the securement locations, 30 inches wide minimum by 48 inches long minimum by 40 inches high minimum, plus additional space as may be required by sections 23(a)(2), 23(d)(2) and 25(c). A vehicle shall not be required to be designed or modified to accommodate wheelchairs and mobility aids which exceed these dimensions or which weigh more than 660 pounds when occupied.

(d) If stations or stops are constructed to provide a boarding and alighting area at the vehicle floor height, the boarding and alighting area shall comply with 810.5.1, 810.5.2, 810.6, 810.7 and 810.8 of Appendix D of 36 CFR part 1191. If stations or stops are constructed to provide a boarding and alighting area on a sidewalk or road shoulder, the boarding and alighting area shall comply with 810.2, 810.3 and 810.4 of the Appendix D of 36 CFR part 1191. If construction is carried out by an entity other than the transportation provider, compliance with the above sections shall be to the extent that the transportation provider has control of, or can exert influence over, the design and construction of boarding and alighting areas.

*1192.23 Mobility aid accessibility.*

(a) General. Vehicles covered by this subpart shall provide the following:

> (1) A level-change mechanism or boarding device (e.g., lift, bridgeplate or ramp) complying with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section at all doors intended for use by persons using wheelchairs or mobility aids wherever the separation between vehicle floor and boarding and alighting area exceeds either 2 inches horizontally or 5/8 inch vertically.
>
> (2) Sufficient clearances to permit a wheelchair or other mobility aid user to reach securement locations. At least one route to each securement location shall have a clear width of 36 inches minimum, measured from floor level to a height of 40 inches, and a clear width of 30 inches above a height of 40 inches. Where a turn is required, sufficient maneuvering space shall be provided to allow a wheelchair or mobility aid having a width of 30 inches maximum and a length of 48 inches maximum to turn with a minimum of back-and-forth movement.
>
> (3) At least two securement locations and devices, complying with paragraph (d) of this section on vehicles in excess of 22 feet in length and at least one securement location and device complying with paragraph (d) of this section on vehicles 22 feet in length or less.

(b) Vehicle lift.

> (1) Design load. The design load of the lift shall be at least 660 pounds. Working parts, such as cables, pulleys, and shafts, which can be expected to wear, and upon which the lift depends for support of the load, shall have a safety factor of at least six, based on the ultimate strength of the material. Nonworking parts, such as platform, frame, and attachment hardware which would not be expected to wear, shall have a safety factor of at least three, based on the ultimate strength of the material.
>
> (2) Controls.\
> (i) Requirements. The controls shall be interlocked with the vehicle brakes, transmission, or door, or shall provide other appropriate mechanisms or systems, to ensure that the vehicle cannot be moved when the lift is not stowed and that the lift cannot be deployed unless the interlocks or systems are engaged so that the vehicle cannot be moved. The lift shall deploy to all levels (i.e., roadway, curb, and intermediate positions) normally encountered in the operating environment. Where provided, each control for deploying, lowering, raising, and stowing the lift and lowering the roll-off barrier shall be of a momentary contact type requiring continuous manual pressure by the operator and shall not allow improper lift sequencing when the lift platform is occupied. The controls shall allow reversal of the lift operation sequence, such as raising or lowering a platform that is part way down, without allowing an occupied platform to fold or retract into the stowed position.\
> (ii) Exception. Where the lift is designed to deploy with its long dimension parallel to the vehicle axis and which pivots into or out of the vehicle while occupied (i.e., "rotary lift"), the requirements of this paragraph prohibiting the lift from being stowed while occupied shall not apply if the stowed position is within the passenger compartment and the lift is intended to be stowed while occupied.
>
> (3) Emergency operation. The lift shall incorporate an emergency method of deploying, lowering to ground level with a lift occupant, and raising and stowing the empty lift if the power to the lift fails. No emergency method, manual or otherwise, shall be capable of being operated in a manner that could be hazardous to the lift occupant or to the operator when operated according to manufacturer's instructions, and shall not permit the platform to be stowed or folded when occupied, unless the lift is a rotary lift and is intended to be stowed while occupied.
>
> (4) Power or equipment failure. Platforms stowed in a vertical position, and deployed platforms when occupied, shall have provisions to prevent their deploying, falling, or folding any faster than 12 inches/second or their dropping of an occupant in the event of a single failure of any load carrying component.
>
> (5) Platform barriers. The lift platform shall be equipped with barriers to prevent any of the wheels of a wheelchair or mobility aid from rolling off the platform during its operation. A movable barrier or inherent design feature shall prevent a wheelchair or mobility aid from rolling off the edge closest to the vehicle until the platform is in its fully raised position. Each side of the lift platform which extends beyond the vehicle in its raised position shall have a barrier a minimum 1 1/2 inches high. Such barriers shall not interfere with maneuvering into or out of the aisle. The loading-edge barrier (outer barrier) which functions as a loading ramp when the lift is at a boarding and alighting area level, shall be sufficient when raised or closed, or a supplementary system shall be provided, to prevent a power wheelchair or mobility aid from riding over or defeating it. The outer barrier of the lift shall automatically raise or close, or a supplementary system shall automatically engage, and remain raised, closed, or engaged at all times that the platform is more than 3 inches above the roadway or boarding and alighting area and the platform is occupied. Alternatively, a barrier or system may be raised, lowered, opened, closed, engaged, or disengaged by the lift operator, provided an interlock or inherent design feature prevents the lift from rising unless the barrier is raised or closed or the supplementary system is engaged.
>
> (6) Platform surface. The platform surface shall be free of any protrusions over 1/4 inch high and shall be slip resistant. The platform shall have a minimum clear width of 28 1/2 inches at the platform, a minimum clear width of 30 inches measured from 2 inches above the platform surface to a height of 40 inches above the platform, and a minimum clear length of 48 inches measured from 2 inches above the surface of the platform to a height of 40 inches above the surface of the platform. (See Fig. 1)
>
> (7) Platform gaps. Any openings between the platform surface and the raised barriers shall not permit a sphere with a diameter of 5/8 inch to pass through. When the platform is at vehicle floor height with the inner barrier (if applicable) down or retracted, gaps between the forward lift platform edge and the vehicle floor shall not exceed 1/2 inch horizontally and 5/8 inch vertically. Platforms on semi-automatic lifts may have a hand hold not exceeding 1 1/2 inches by 4 1/2 inches located between the edge barriers.
>
> (8) Platform entrance ramp. The entrance ramp, or loading-edge barrier used as a ramp, shall not exceed a slope of 1:8, measured on level ground, for a maximum rise of 3 inches, and the transition from roadway or boarding and alighting area to ramp may be vertical without edge treatment up to 1/4 inch. Thresholds between 1/4 inch and 1/2 inch high shall be beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2.
>
> (9) Platform deflection. The lift platform (not including the entrance ramp) shall not deflect more than 3 degrees (exclusive of vehicle roll or pitch) in any direction between its unloaded position and its position when loaded with 660 pounds applied through a 26 inch by 26 inch test pallet at the centroid of the platform.
>
> (10) Platform movement. No part of the platform shall move at a rate exceeding 6 inches/second during lowering and lifting an occupant, and shall not exceed 12 inches/second during deploying or stowing. This requirement does not apply to the deployment or stowage cycles of lifts that are manually deployed or stowed. The maximum platform horizontal and vertical acceleration when occupied shall be 0.3g.
>
> (11) Boarding direction. The lift shall permit both inboard and outboard facing of wheelchair and mobility aid users.
>
> (12) Use by standees. Lifts shall accommodate persons using walkers, crutches, canes or braces or who otherwise have difficulty using steps. The platform may be marked to indicate a preferred standing position.
>
> (13) Handrails. Platforms on lifts shall be equipped with handrails on two sides, which move in tandem with the lift, and which shall be graspable and provide support to standees throughout the entire lift operation. Handrails shall have a usable component at least 8 inches long with the lowest portion a minimum 30 inches above the platform and the highest portion a maximum 38 inches above the platform. The handrails shall be capable of withstanding a force of 100 pounds concentrated at any point on the handrail without permanent deformation of the rail or its supporting structure. The handrail shall have a cross-sectional diameter between 1 1/4 inches and 2 inches or shall provide an equivalent grasping surface, and have eased edges with corner radii of not less than 1/8 inch. Handrails shall be placed to provide a minimum 1 1/2 inches knuckle clearance from the nearest adjacent surface. Handrails shall not interfere with wheelchair or mobility aid maneuverability when entering or leaving the vehicle.

(c) Vehicle ramps and bridgeplates.

> (1) Design load. Ramps and bridgeplates 30 inches or longer shall support a load of 660 pounds, placed at the centroid of the ramp or bridgeplate distributed over an area of 26 inches by 26 inches, with a safety factor of at least 3 based on the ultimate strength of the material. Ramps or bridgeplates shorter than 30 inches shall support a load of 330 pounds. Folding or telescoping ramps are permitted provided they meet all structural requirements of this section.
>
> (2) Surface. The surface of ramps and bridgeplates shall be slip resistant, continuous from edge to edge, and shall not have protrusions from the surface greater than 1/4 inch high. Ramps and bridgeplates shall have a clear width of 30 inches.
>
> (3) Threshold. The transition from boarding and alighting areas to ramps and bridgeplates and the transition from vehicle floor to ramps and bridgeplates may be vertical without edge treatment up to 1/4 inch. Changes in level between 1/4 inch and 1/2 inch shall be beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2.
>
> (4) Barriers. Each side of ramps and bridgeplates shall have barriers at least 2 inches high along all portions of ramps and bridgeplates more than 3 inches above the boarding and alighting surface.
>
> (5) Slope. The slope of all ramps and bridgeplates shall not exceed 1:8. Only one device shall be required to have a maximum slope of 1:8 when deployed to roadway, provided all required securement locations are connected to it by a route complying with (a)(2). All other devices shall not exceed a slope of 1:8 when deployed to the intended boarding and alighting areas.
>
> (6) Attachment. When in use for boarding or alighting, ramps and bridgeplates shall be firmly attached to the vehicle so that they are not subject to displacement when in use and that no gap between vehicle and ramp permits the passage of a sphere having a diameter of 5/8 inch.
>
> (7) Stowage. A compartment, securement system, or other appropriate method shall be provided to ensure that stowed ramps and bridgeplates, including portable ramps and bridgeplates stowed in the passenger area, do not impinge on a passenger's wheelchair or mobility aid or pose any hazard to passengers in the event of a sudden stop or maneuver.
>
> (8) Handrails. If provided, handrails shall allow persons with disabilities to grasp them from outside the vehicle while starting to board, and to continue to use them throughout the boarding process, and shall have the top between 30 inches and 38 inches above the ramp or bridgeplate surface. The handrails shall be capable of withstanding a force of 100 pounds concentrated at any point on the handrail without permanent deformation of the rail or its supporting structure. The handrail shall have a cross-sectional diameter of 1 1/4 inches minimum to 2 inches maximum or shall provide an equivalent grasping surface, and have eased edges with corner radii of not less than 1/8 inch. Handrails shall not interfere with wheelchair or mobility aid maneuverability when\
> entering or leaving the vehicle.
>
> (9) Operation. Power operated ramps and bridgeplates shall be deployable manually.

(d) Securement devices.

> (1) Design load. Securement systems on vehicles with GVWRs of 30,000 pounds or above, and their attachments to such vehicles, shall restrain a force in the forward longitudinal direction of up to 2,000 pounds per securement leg or clamping mechanism and a minimum of 4,000 pounds for each mobility aid. Securement systems on vehicles with GVWRs of up to 30,000 pounds, and their attachments to such vehicles, shall restrain a force in the forward longitudinal direction of up to 2,500 pounds per securement leg or clamping mechanism and a minimum of 5,000 pounds for each mobility aid.
>
> (2) Location and size. The securement system shall be placed as near to the accessible entrance as practicable and shall have a clear floor area of 30 inches minimum by 48 inches minimum. One full unobstructed side of the clear floor area shall adjoin or overlap an access route. If a clear floor area is located in a bay or otherwise confined on all or part of three sides, additional maneuvering clearances shall be provided in accordance with the following:\
> (i) Forward Approach. Bays shall be 36 inches (915 mm) wide minimum where the depth exceeds 24 inches (610 mm). See figure 1.\
> (ii) Parallel Approach. Bays shall be 60 inches (1525 mm) wide minimum where the depth exceeds 15 inches (380 mm). See figure 2.\
