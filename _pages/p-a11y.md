The U.S. Access Board is committed to making its information and communication technologies accessible to individuals with disabilities by meeting or exceeding the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Section 508 is a federal law that requires agencies to provide individuals with disabilities access to electronic and information technology and data comparable to those who do not have disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency.  To meet this commitment, our web pages have been designed to meet or exceed the Section 508 standards and to conform to the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, Level AA.

The Section 508 standards are the technical requirements and criteria that are used to measure conformance with the law.  More information on Section 508 and the technical standards can be found at [www.section508.gov](http://www.section508.gov/) and on our website.  The W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 can be found at [www.w3.org/tr/wcag20](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).

In addition to features necessary for supporting the Section 508 standards and WCAG 2.0, section headings are used to organize the content, and all videos incorporate descriptive narration in addition to open captions.  In developing our site, templates were subjected to automated and end-user testing.  All new content is subjected to expert inspection.  Template updates are checked for conformance with the Section 508 standards and WCAG 2.0 before they are deployed.

All our content is provided in HTML.  Portable Document Format (PDF) versions are available for most of our longer documents.  One popular viewer for PDF files is [Acrobat Reader](http://www.adobe.com/products/reader.html).  No endorsement is implied.
