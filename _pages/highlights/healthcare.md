The Board has issued accessibility standards for medical diagnostic equipment under the “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.” The Board also developed guidance on accessible prescription drug container labels. The Board is partnering with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx®) Tech accessibility program to host a report on best practices for the design of accessible COVID-19 home tests.

### [Best Practices for the Design of Accessible COVID-19 Home Tests]({{ site.baseurl }}/tad/radx/)
This document captures and publicizes learnings from the NIH RADx® Tech accessibility program to assist manufacturers in the design of COVID-19 and other in vitro diagnostic (IVD) home tests that ensure greater accessibility for users that have no vision or low vision, a reduced range of dexterity or motor skills, and those that are aging.
