Information and communication technology (ICT) must be accessible to people with physical, sensory, and cognitive disabilities. Access to information and communication technology is addressed by Board standards and guidelines issued under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and Section 255 of the Communications Act.

### [Section 508 Standards]({{ site.baseurl }}/ict/#508-chapter-1-application-and-administration)
The Section 508 Standards apply to electronic and information technology procured by the federal government, including computer hardware and software, websites, multimedia such as video, phone systems, and copiers. These standards are part of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and require access for both members of the public and federal employees to such technologies when developed, procured, maintained, or used by federal agencies. The Access Board provides technical guidance and training on the Section 508 Standards.

### [Section 255 Guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/ict/#255ch1)
The Section 255 Guidelines address access to telecommunications products and services and apply to manufacturers of telecommunication equipment. The Board issued accessibility guidelines under Section 255 to cover wired and wireless telecommunication devices, other products that have a telecommunication service capability, and equipment that carriers use to provide services.
