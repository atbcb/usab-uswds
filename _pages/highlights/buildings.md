Buildings and facilities must be accessible to people with disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Architectural Barriers Act.  Accessibility standards issued under these laws govern the design, construction, and alteration of many types of buildings and sites in the private and public sectors.  


### [ADA Accessibility Standards]({{ site.baseurl }}/ada/)
The ADA Accessibility Standards apply to places of public accommodation, commercial facilities, and state and local government facilities, including public transportation facilities.  The Access Board provides technical guidance and training on the ADA Standards.  


###  [ABA Accessibility Standards]({{ site.baseurl }}/aba/)
The ABA Accessibility Standards apply to facilities that are funded by the federal government.   This includes federal buildings, such as post offices, social security offices, federal courthouses and prisons, and national parks, as well as other facilities that receive federal grants or loans, such as public housing units and mass transit systems.  The Access Board provides technical guidance and training on the ABA Standards.  It also enforces compliance with ABA Standards through the investigation of complaints.
